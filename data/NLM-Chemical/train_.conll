describe  O
sperm  O
swimming  O
pattern  O
.  O

Some  O
of  O
the  O
CASA  O
parameters  O
were  O
strongly  O
correlated  O
with  O
each  O
other  O
because  O
they  O
describe  O
different  O
aspects  O
of  O
the  O
same  O
movement  O
.  O

Measures  O
of  O
progression  O
  O
VAP  O
and  O
VSL  O
  O
were  O
highly  O
correlated  O
  O
which  O
indicated  O
they  O
were  O
likely  O
measuring  O
a  O
similar  O
characteristic  O
of  O
sperm  O
movement  O
.  O

We  O
chose  O
VSL  O
over  O
VAP  O
as  O
a  O
measure  O
of  O
progression  O
because  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
direct  O
measurement  O
as  O
opposed  O
to  O
a  O
mathematically  O
smoothed  O
value  O
.  O

VCL  O
was  O
chosen  O
as  O
a  O
measure  O
of  O
vigor  O
and  O
was  O
strongly  O
and  O
positively  O
correlated  O
with  O
ALH  O
but  O
not  O
correlated  O
with  O
BCF  O
.  O

The  O
two  O
measures  O
of  O
swimming  O
pattern  O
(  O
LIN  O
and  O
STR  O
)  O
were  O
strongly  O
correlated  O
  O
indicating  O
they  O
were  O
likely  O
measuring  O
a  O
similar  O
characteristic  O
of  O
sperm  O
movement  O
.  O

We  O
chose  O
LIN  O
as  O
a  O
measure  O
of  O
swimming  O
pattern  O
because  O
the  O
other  O
parameters  O
chosen  O
for  O
this  O
study  O
(  O
VSL  O
and  O
VCL  O
)  O
are  O
components  O
of  O
LIN  O
and  O
not  O
of  O
STR  O
.  O

Therefore  O
  O
we  O
chose  O
measure  O
of  O
progression  O
(  O
VSL  O
)  O
vigor  O
(  O
VCL  O
)  O
and  O
swimming  O

(  O
LIN  O
)  O
for  O
statistical  O
analyses  O
.  O

These  O
three  O

are  O
also  O
not  O

on  O

Statistical  O

were  O
performed  O
using  O

both  O
as  O
a  O

Men  O

For  O
the  O

we  O
used  O
multiple  O

.  O

Nine  O
azoospermic  O

were  O
excluded  O
from  O
the  O

because  O

Insecticide  O

Normality  O
of  O
the  O

was  O
assessed  O
  O

the  O

.  O

The  O
remaining  O
semen  O
parameters  O
and  O
CASA  O

were  O
normally  O
distributed  O
and  O
not  O
transformed  O
.  O

Semen  O
parameters  O
were  O
stratified  O
by  O
demographic  O
categories  O
to  O
investigate  O
the  O
potential  O
for  O

.  O

Associations  O
between  O
demographic  O
variables  O
and  O
insecticide  O

were  O
also  O

We  O
considered  O

  O
a  O
previous  O

  O
and  O
abstinence  O
time  O
as  O
potential  O
covariates  O
.  O

Inclusion  O
of  O
covariates  O
in  O
the  O
models  O
was  O
based  O
on  O
statistical  O
and  O
biological  O
considerations  O
(  O
Hosmer  O
and  O
Lemeshow  O
1989  O
).  O

Covariates  O
were  O
entered  O
into  O
the  O
models  O
individually  O
in  O
a  O
forward  O

manner  O
.  O

Covariates  O
that  O
changed  O
the  O
exposure  O
parameter  O
estimate  O
by  O
greater  O
than  O
10  O
%  O
were  O
retained  O
in  O
the  O
multivariate  O
model  O
and  O
were  O
considered  O
confounders  O
.  O

There  O
was  O
evidence  O
of  O
confounding  O
by  O
both  O
age  O

in  O
many  O
  O
but  O
not  O
all  O
  O
of  O
the  O
models  O
for  O
the  O
various  O

.  O

However  O
  O
because  O
there  O
is  O
evidence  O
that  O
age  O
and  O
abstinence  O
time  O
are  O
associated  O
with  O

Functional  O
defects  O
of  O
sperm  O
may  O
be  O
an  O
important  O
factor  O
in  O
male  O
infertility  O
.  O

The  O
role  O
of  O
reactive    B-Chemical
oxygen    I-Chemical
species    I-Chemical
(  O
ROS    B-Chemical
)  O
in  O
male  O
infertility  O
has  O
been  O
suggested  O
in  O
studies  O
that  O
found  O
higher  O
seminal  O
ROS    B-Chemical
levels  O
in  O
infertile  O
men  O
compared  O
with  O
fertile  O
controls  O
(  O
Agarwal  O
et  O
al  O
.  O

1994  O
  O
Pasqualotto  O
et  O

Sperm  O
cells  O
do  O
not  O
have  O
cytoplasmic  O
defense  O
enzymes  O
(  O
e  O
.  O
g  O
.  O
catalase  O
)  O
that  O
serve  O
as  O
ROS    B-Chemical
scavengers  O
.  O

Consequently  O
  O
sperm  O
  O
which  O
have  O
a  O
high  O
content  O
of  O
polyunsaturated    B-Chemical
fatty    I-Chemical
acids    I-Chemical
  O
are  O
more  O
susceptible  O
to  O
the  O
oxidative  O
deterioration  O
of  O
polyunsaturated    B-Chemical
fatty    I-Chemical
acids    I-Chemical
known  O
as  O
lipid    B-Chemical
peroxidation  O
(  O
Sharma  O
and  O
Agarwal  O
1996  O
).  O

Lipid    B-Chemical
peroxidation  O
causes  O
the  O
plasma  O
membrane  O
to  O
lose  O
its  O
fluidity  O
and  O
integrity  O
  O
ultimately  O
leading  O
to  O
loss  O
of  O
sperm  O
function  O
(  O
Aitken  O
1995  O
).  O

Loss  O
of  O
membrane  O
fluidity  O
also  O
impairs  O
the  O
cell  O
membrane  O
ion    B-Chemical
exchange  O
that  O
controls  O
sperm  O
movement  O
(  O
Rao  O
et  O
al  O
.  O

1989  O
).  O

Carbaryl    B-Chemical
causes  O
lipid    B-Chemical
peroxidation  O
at  O
low  O
concentrations  O
by  O
either  O
efficiently  O
lowering  O
the  O
intracellular  O
level  O
of  O
glutathione    B-Chemical
  O
which  O
is  O
associated  O
with  O
an  O
increase  O
in  O
ROS    B-Chemical
  O
or  O
through  O
the  O
inhibition  O
of  O
excision  O
esterases  O
(  O
Soderpalm  O
-  O
Berndes  O
and  O
Onfelt  O
1988  O
).  O

Thus  O
  O
it  O
is  O
biologically  O
plausible  O
that  O
exposure  O
to  O
carbaryl    B-Chemical
may  O
be  O
associated  O
with  O
altered  O
semen  O
quality  O
  O
particularly  O
sperm  O
motility  O
and  O
sperm  O
motion  O
.  O

Biomonitoring  O
for  O
insecticide  O
metabolite  O
concentrations  O
in  O
urine  O
is  O
a  O
commonly  O
used  O
indicator  O
of  O
internal  O
dose  O
integrating  O
the  O
various  O
routes  O
through  O
which  O
the  O
contaminant  O
enters  O
the  O
body  O
(  O
Barr  O
et  O
al  O
.  O

1999  O
).  O

However  O
  O
nonpersistent  O
insecticides  O
are  O
metabolized  O
and  O
excreted  O
rapidly  O
.  O

For  O
example  O
  O
TCPY    B-Chemical
has  O
an  O
estimated  O
half  O

life  O
of  O
27  O
hr  O
in  O
humans  O
(  O
Nolan  O
et  O
al  O
.  O

1984  O
)  O
and  O
levels  O
of  O
both  O
TCPY    B-Chemical
and  O
1N    B-Chemical
measured  O
in  O
urine  O
reflect  O
insecticide  O
exposure  O
in  O
the  O
previous  O
24  O

48  O
hr  O
(  O
Maroni  O

Spermatogenesis  O
is  O
a  O
cyclical  O
process  O
that  O
takes  O
approximately  O
3  O
months  O
.  O

Although  O
insecticide  O
metabolite  O
levels  O
in  O
urine  O
can  O
vary  O
considerably  O
over  O
time  O
  O

The  O

using  O

may  O
reflect  O
tubular  O

thus  O
excretion  O

that  O

independent  O
of  O

Adjustment  O
of  O

concentration  O

using  O

may  O
introduce  O
additional  O

  O
further  O
limiting  O
the  O

.  O

Strengths  O
of  O
the  O

study  O
include  O
its  O
size  O
and  O
high  O
participation  O
rate  O
and  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
biological  O
markers  O
of  O
exposure  O
.  O

To  O
test  O
the  O
robustness  O
of  O
the  O
data  O
analysis  O
  O
we  O
used  O
several  O
modeling  O
approaches  O
in  O
which  O
exposures  O
and  O
outcomes  O
were  O
used  O
as  O
both  O
continuous  O
and  O
categorical  O
measures  O
.  O

The  O
results  O
were  O
consistent  O
across  O
modeling  O
approaches  O
  O
suggesting  O
that  O
the  O
data  O
were  O
not  O
sensitive  O
to  O
the  O
statistical  O
analysis  O
methods  O
used  O
.  O

Study  O
weaknesses  O
included  O
collecting  O
only  O
a  O
single  O
urine  O
sample  O
as  O
an  O
estimate  O
of  O
3  O
-  O
month  O
exposure  O
and  O
collecting  O
only  O
a  O
single  O
semen  O
sample  O
to  O
assess  O
semen  O
quality  O
.  O

However  O
  O
our  O
earlier  O
work  O
supported  O
the  O
utility  O
of  O
a  O
single  O
urine  O
specimen  O
as  O
predictive  O
of  O
3  O
-  O

average  O
exposure  O
(  O
Meeker  O

In  O
conclusion  O
  O
associations  O
between  O
1N    B-Chemical
and  O
sperm  O
concentration  O
and  O
motility  O
were  O
found  O
that  O
are  O
consistent  O
with  O
animal  O
studies  O
of  O
carbaryl    B-Chemical
exposure  O
.  O

The  O
sperm  O
motion  O
parameter  O
most  O
strongly  O
associated  O
with  O
urinary  O
1N    B-Chemical
was  O
VSL  O
  O
although  O
suggestive  O
associations  O
of  O
1N    B-Chemical
with  O
VCL  O
and  O
LIN  O
were  O
also  O
found  O
.  O

There  O
were  O
also  O
suggestive  O
associations  O
between  O
TCPY    B-Chemical
and  O
sperm  O
concentration  O
and  O
motility  O
  O
but  O
they  O
are  O
difficult  O
to  O
interpret  O
because  O
there  O
are  O
currently  O
limited  O
human  O
and  O
animal  O
data  O
.  O

Because  O
most  O
of  O
the  O
U  O
.  O
S  O
.  O

population  O
is  O
exposed  O
to  O
these  O
insecticides  O
(  O
CDC  O
2003  O
)  O
the  O
public  O
health  O
significance  O
of  O
an  O
association  O
with  O
semen  O
quality  O
is  O
potentially  O
large  O
.  O

For  O
instance  O
  O
our  O
results  O
suggest  O
that  O
an  O
interquartile  O
range  O
increase  O
in  O
carbaryl    B-Chemical
metabolite  O
levels  O
in  O
urine  O
is  O
associated  O
with  O
a  O
4  O
%  O
decrease  O
in  O
sperm  O
motility  O
.  O

Although  O
this  O
may  O
not  O
alter  O
an  O
individual  O
man  O
’  O
s  O
fertility  O
  O
a  O
4  O
%  O
decrease  O
in  O
the  O
mean  O
of  O
the  O
distribution  O
of  O
sperm  O
motility  O
among  O
U  O
.  O
S  O
.  O

men  O
may  O
result  O
in  O
a  O
significant  O
increase  O
in  O
the  O
number  O
of  O
men  O
in  O
the  O
lower  O
tail  O
of  O
the  O
sperm  O
motility  O
distribution  O
  O
increasing  O
the  O
number  O
of  O
subfertile  O
men  O
.  O

Further  O
studies  O
are  O
needed  O
to  O
confirm  O
these  O
preliminary  O
findings  O
and  O
assess  O
the  O
potential  O

Current  O

indicate  O
that  O

an  O

  O
which  O

Apolipoprotein  O
E  O
(  O
apoE  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
polymorphic  O
multifunctional  O
protein  O
with  O
three  O
common  O
isoforms  O
in  O
humans  O
(  O
E2  O
  O
E3  O
  O
and  O
E4  O
).  O

ApoE3  O
is  O
the  O
wild  O
-  O
type  O
and  O
most  O
common  O
isoform  O
  O
while  O
apoE4  O
carriers  O
account  O
for  O
about  O
25  O
%  O
of  O
the  O
Caucasian  O
population  O
[  O
1  O
].  O

Presence  O
of  O
the  O
apoE4  O
allele  O
is  O
associated  O
with  O
a  O
40  O
–  O
50  O
%  O
higher  O
risk  O
of  O
cardiovascular  O
disease  O
(  O
CVD  O
)  O
[  O
2  O
]  O
and  O
apoE4  O
is  O
the  O
major  O
known  O
genetic  O
risk  O
factor  O
for  O
maturity  O
-  O
onset  O
Alzheimer  O
’  O
s  O
disease  O
(  O
AD  O
)  O
[  O

].  O

Although  O
apoE4  O
is  O
strongly  O
linked  O
to  O
both  O
diseases  O
  O
the  O
molecular  O
basis  O
of  O
these  O
associations  O
remains  O
uncertain  O
.  O

Traditionally  O
  O
the  O
differential  O
risk  O
has  O
been  O
attributed  O
to  O
the  O
increased  O
low  O
density  O
lipoprotein  O
cholesterol  O
(∼  O
8  O
%)  O
observed  O
in  O
apoE4  O
carriers  O
  O
but  O
it  O
is  O
becoming  O
increasingly  O
evident  O
that  O
this  O
alone  O
cannot  O
explain  O
the  O
disease  O
differential  O
[  O

].  O

ApoE  O
is  O
not  O
only  O
synthesised  O
by  O
the  O
liver  O
  O
but  O
also  O
in  O
the  O
brain  O
and  O
by  O
resident  O
macrophages  O
[  O
5  O
]  O
in  O
the  O
atherosclerotic  O
wall  O
  O
where  O
it  O
exerts  O
atheroprotective  O
actions  O
  O
independent  O
of  O
its  O
role  O
in  O
lipid  O
metabolism  O
[  O
6  O
].  O

These  O
localised  O
functions  O
include  O
regulation  O
of  O
smooth  O
muscle  O
cell  O
migration  O
and  O
proliferation  O
[  O

]  O
inhibition  O
of  O

in  O
endothelial  O
cells  O
[  O

]  O
and  O
inhibition  O
of  O
platelet  O
aggregation  O
[  O

].  O

In  O
addition  O
to  O
its  O
paracrine  O
effect  O
on  O
surrounding  O
cells  O
  O
apoE  O
has  O
also  O
been  O
shown  O
to  O
impact  O
on  O
macrophage  O
function  O
by  O
promoting  O
cholesterol    B-Chemical
efflux  O
[  O

and  O
modulating  O
NO    B-Chemical
production  O
[  O

Inflammation  O
and  O
oxidative  O
stress  O
are  O
key  O
features  O
of  O
the  O
pathology  O
of  O
atherosclerosis  O
and  O
AD  O
.  O

A  O
limited  O
number  O
of  O
studies  O
  O
which  O
have  O
largely  O
focussed  O
on  O
brain  O
biology  O
and  O
neurodegeneration  O
[  O

  O

have  O
reported  O
on  O
the  O
immuno  O

properties  O
of  O
apoE  O
and  O
its  O
impact  O
on  O
inflammatory  O
mediators  O
[  O

However  O
  O
little  O
is  O
known  O
about  O
the  O
possible  O
role  O
of  O
apoE  O
genotype  O
as  O
a  O

of  O
the  O
macrophage  O

  O
we  O

affects  O

now  O
we  O

  O
we  O
extend  O
these  O

by  O
reporting  O
on  O
an  O

of  O

  O

applied  O
to  O

  O

that  O

a  O

  O
and  O
that  O

is  O
regarded  O
to  O
be  O
relevant  O
in  O
the  O
pathogenesis  O
of  O

[  O

Following  O
LPS    B-Chemical
stimulation  O
  O
higher  O
mRNA  O
levels  O
of  O
the  O
pro  O

inflammatory  O
cytokines  O

and  O
  O
IL1β  O
  O
and  O
the  O

  O
with  O
a  O
trend  O
towards  O
lower  O
levels  O
of  O
the  O
anti  O

inflammatory  O
cytokine  O
IL10  O
were  O
evident  O
in  O
the  O
apoE4  O
cell  O
line  O
.  O

No  O
differences  O
were  O
observed  O
for  O
IL6  O
  O
which  O
is  O
known  O
to  O
act  O
as  O
both  O
a  O
pro  O

and  O
anti  O

inflammatory  O
mediator  O
.  O

Furthermore  O
  O
these  O
changes  O
were  O
reflected  O
by  O
the  O
protein  O
levels  O
in  O
the  O
medium  O
with  O
the  O
greatest  O
differences  O
evident  O
for  O
TNFα  O
and  O
IL10  O
.  O

TNFα  O
is  O
pleiotropic  O
and  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
most  O
important  O
pro  O

inflammatory  O
and  O
immuno  O
-  O
modulatory  O
cytokines  O
involved  O
in  O
the  O
process  O
of  O
atherogenesis  O
.  O

For  O
instance  O
  O
TNFα  O
participates  O
in  O
the  O
recruitment  O
and  O
activation  O
of  O
inflammatory  O
cells  O
into  O
the  O
vessel  O
wall  O
by  O
promoting  O
matrix  O
degradation  O
[  O

]  O
and  O
by  O
enhancing  O
expression  O
of  O
adhesion  O
molecules  O
on  O
endothelial  O
cells  O
[  O
21  O
].  O

In  O
contrast  O
  O
IL10  O
is  O
a  O
potent  O
anti  O
-  O
inflammatory  O
cytokine  O
  O
which  O
affects  O
several  O
signalling  O
pathways  O
and  O
destabilizes  O
the  O
mRNA  O
of  O
pro  O
-  O
inflammatory  O
genes  O
  O
to  O
contribute  O
in  O
the  O
resolution  O
of  O
the  O
inflammatory  O
process  O
[  O
22  O
].  O

Whether  O
the  O
higher  O
levels  O
of  O
TNFα  O
and  O
IL1β  O
observed  O
in  O
apoE4  O
macrophages  O
were  O
partly  O
due  O
to  O
decreased  O
levels  O
of  O
IL10  O
or  O
due  O
to  O
other  O
mechanisms  O
cannot  O
be  O
concluded  O
.  O

The  O
increased  O
pro  O

inflammatory  O
cytokine  O
response  O
observed  O
in  O
our  O
apoE4  O
monocyte  O
-  O
macrophage  O
cell  O
model  O
is  O
in  O
agreement  O
with  O
the  O
limited  O
amount  O
of  O
data  O
available  O
from  O
other  O
authors  O
  O
which  O
have  O
examined  O
associations  O
between  O
apoE  O
genotype  O
and  O
inflammation  O
in  O
the  O
brain  O
.  O

By  O
using  O
transgenic  O
mice  O

human  O
apoE3  O
or  O
apoE4  O
  O
Lynch  O
et  O

.  O

[  O

determined  O
that  O
apoE4  O
mice  O
showed  O
elevated  O
systemic  O
and  O
brain  O
pro  O

inflammatory  O
cytokines  O
following  O
intravenous  O
administration  O
of  O
LPS    B-Chemical
  O
and  O
Ophir  O
et  O
al  O
.  O

[  O
12  O
]  O
demonstrated  O
that  O
the  O
expression  O
of  O
inflammation  O
genes  O
was  O
higher  O
and  O
more  O
prolongated  O
in  O
the  O
brains  O
of  O
apoE4  O
following  O
intracerebroventricular  O
injection  O
of  O
LPS    B-Chemical
.  O

Furthermore  O
  O
Maezawa  O
et  O
al  O
.  O

demonstrated  O
that  O
the  O
isoform  O
-  O
specific  O
patterns  O
in  O
cytokine  O
production  O
(  O
apoE4  O
>  O
apoE3  O
>  O
apoE2  O
)  O
was  O
specific  O
of  O
microglia  O
and  O
could  O
not  O
be  O
observed  O
in  O
astroglia  O
cultures  O
[  O
13  O
  O
23  O
].  O

This  O
is  O
particularly  O
relevant  O
to  O
our  O
studies  O
given  O
that  O
microglia  O
share  O
many  O
functional  O
characteristics  O
with  O
macrophages  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
to  O
the  O
increased  O
pro  O
-  O
inflammatory  O
response  O
  O
our  O
findings  O
reveal  O
that  O
apoE4  O
macrophages  O
produce  O
decreased  O
amounts  O
of  O
IL10  O
.  O

A  O
recent  O
study  O
by  O
Tziakas  O
et  O
al  O
.  O

[  O
24  O
]  O
shows  O
  O
in  O
accordance  O
with  O
our  O
results  O
  O
that  O
apoE4  O
carriers  O
with  O
acute  O
coronary  O
syndrome  O
and  O
chronic  O
stable  O
angina  O
patients  O
have  O
lower  O
circulating  O
levels  O
of  O
IL10  O
than  O
the  O
non  O
-  O
apoE4  O
patients  O
.  O

Therefore  O
taken  O
together  O
with  O
the  O
previous  O
findings  O
  O
our  O
data  O
support  O
the  O
hypothesis  O
  O
that  O
apoE4  O
carriers  O
may  O
show  O
an  O
“  O

imbalance  O
”  O
between  O
pro  O

and  O
anti  O

[  O

The  O
regulation  O
of  O

is  O
highly  O
complex  O
  O
but  O
the  O

NF  O

κB  O
is  O
a  O
redox  O
sensitive  O
transcription  O
factor  O
  O
and  O
therefore  O
it  O
was  O
hypothesised  O
that  O
the  O
increased  O
oxidative  O
stress  O
observed  O
in  O
the  O
apoE4  O
macrophages  O
could  O
contribute  O
to  O
a  O
higher  O
cytokine  O
production  O
by  O
enhancing  O
the  O
activation  O
of  O
NF  O
-  O
κB  O
.  O

Here  O
  O
we  O
demonstrate  O
through  O
a  O
reporter  O
gene  O
assay  O
  O
that  O
the  O
activity  O
of  O
NF  O

κB  O
under  O
basal  O
conditions  O
is  O
higher  O
in  O
apoE4  O

  O
and  O
that  O
upon  O
stimulation  O
with  O
LPS    B-Chemical
  O
NF  O

κB  O
activity  O
increases  O
in  O
both  O

  O
but  O
the  O
response  O
is  O
more  O
augmented  O
in  O
the  O
apoE4  O

.  O

Again  O
  O
this  O

Under  O
stress  O
situations  O
  O
the  O
integrity  O
of  O
the  O
vascular  O

is  O
maintained  O
by  O
several  O
protective  O
mechanisms  O
  O
which  O
in  O
addition  O
to  O
anti  O

cytokines  O
include  O
other  O
proteins  O
such  O
as  O
inducible  O
heme  O
oxygenase  O

(  O
HO  O

and  O
iron    B-Chemical
[  O

HO  O
-  O
1  O
is  O
expressed  O
in  O
response  O
to  O
oxidative  O
stress  O
  O
and  O
has  O
been  O
shown  O
to  O
be  O
upregulated  O
in  O
atherosclerotic  O
plaques  O
[  O

and  O
in  O

However  O
  O
so  O
far  O
the  O
production  O
and  O
role  O
of  O
HO  O
-  O
1  O
has  O
not  O
been  O
investigated  O
in  O
relation  O
to  O
the  O
human  O
apoE  O
polymorphism  O
.  O

Here  O
  O
for  O
the  O
first  O
time  O
  O
we  O
show  O
that  O
HO  O
-  O
1  O
levels  O
are  O
significantly  O
increased  O
in  O
apoE4  O
-  O
macrophages  O
.  O

ApoE4  O
-  O
macrophages  O
demonstrated  O
increased  O
levels  O
of  O
HO  O
-  O
1  O
under  O
baseline  O
conditions  O
  O
and  O
a  O
stronger  O
up  O
-  O
regulation  O
of  O
HO  O
-  O
1  O
at  O
the  O
mRNA  O
and  O
protein  O
levels  O
following  O
LPS    B-Chemical
application  O
.  O

Whether  O
HO  O
-  O
1  O
exerts  O
anti  O
-  O
inflammatory  O
effects  O
in  O
apoE4  O
macrophages  O
cannot  O
be  O
concluded  O
from  O
the  O
current  O
study  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
inflammatory  O
response  O
was  O
apparently  O
aggravated  O
in  O
apoE4  O
cells  O
  O
we  O
cannot  O
discard  O
the  O
possibility  O
that  O
this  O
could  O
be  O
even  O
more  O
exacerbated  O
without  O
the  O
up  O
-  O
regulation  O
of  O
HO  O
-  O
1  O
observed  O
.  O

Hence  O
  O
one  O
may  O
consider  O
  O
that  O
induction  O
of  O
HO  O
-  O
1  O
by  O
apoE4  O
represents  O
a  O
stress  O
-  O
induced  O
protective  O
response  O
.  O

The  O
current  O
study  O
is  O
suggestive  O
that  O
an  O
impact  O
of  O
apoE  O
genotype  O
on  O
the  O
monocyte  O
inflammatory  O
response  O
may  O
contribute  O
to  O
the  O
higher  O
CVD  O
and  O
AD  O
risk  O
observed  O
in  O
humans  O
with  O
an  O
apoE4  O
genotype  O
.  O

However  O
  O

clarification  O
of  O
the  O
molecular  O
mechanisms  O
  O

complexity  O
of  O
apoE4  O
–  O

  O
as  O
well  O

impact  O
of  O
apoE  O
genotype  O
on  O
inflammation  O
using  O
in  O

showed  O
the  O
highest  O

instead  O

Introduction  O

During  O
the  O
past  O
few  O
years  O
  O
several  O
oil    B-Chemical
-  O
in  O
-  O
water    B-Chemical
emulsions  O
have  O
been  O
introduced  O
on  O
the  O
market  O
for  O
the  O
treatment  O
of  O
dry  O
eye  O
syndrome  O
and  O
are  O
used  O
as  O
tear  O
substitutes  O
or  O
vehicles  O
for  O
active  O
compounds  O
.  O

These  O
oil    B-Chemical
-  O
in  O
-  O
water    B-Chemical
emulsions  O
can  O
be  O
visualized  O
as  O
tiny  O
oil    B-Chemical
droplets  O
suspended  O
within  O
an  O
aqueous  O
phase  O
  O
and  O
they  O
are  O
particularly  O
suitable  O
for  O
dry  O
eye  O
syndromes  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
oil    B-Chemical
supplementation  O
to  O
the  O
tear  O
film  O
.  O

Oil    B-Chemical
-  O
in  O
-  O
water    B-Chemical
emulsions  O
can  O
be  O
charged  O
positively  O
(  O
for  O
example  O
  O
the  O
surface  O
of  O
the  O
tiny  O
droplets  O
becomes  O
cationic  O
)  O
by  O
adding  O
quaternary    B-Chemical
ammonium    I-Chemical
compounds    I-Chemical
(  O
QACs    B-Chemical
)  O
as  O
cationic  O
agents  O
.  O

This  O
cationic  O
emulsion  O
technology  O
presents  O
the  O
advantage  O
of  O
the  O
electrostatic  O
attraction  O
between  O
the  O
positively  O
charged  O
emulsion  O
with  O
the  O
negatively  O
charged  O
ocular  O
surface  O
(  O
cornea  O
and  O
conjunctiva  O
)  O
which  O
allows  O
longer  O
residence  O
time  O
and  O
hence  O
  O
an  O
improved  O
ocular  O
bioavailability  O
of  O
the  O
active  O
compound  O
.  O

However  O
  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
QACs    B-Chemical
as  O
cationic  O
agents  O
at  O
relatively  O
high  O
concentrations  O
in  O
emulsion  O
raises  O
concerns  O
regarding  O
their  O
toxicological  O
profile  O
.  O

As  O
the  O
most  O
commonly  O
used  O
preservative  O
  O
benzalkonium    B-Chemical
chloride    I-Chemical
(  O
BAK    B-Chemical
)  O
has  O
shown  O
its  O
high  O
level  O
of  O
toxicity  O
in  O
vitro  O
and  O
ex  O
vivo  O
by  O
stimulating  O
epithelial  O
cell  O
death  O
  O
acting  O
as  O
pro  O
-  O
inflammatory  O
or  O
pro  O
-  O
apoptotic  O
mediators  O
  O
inducing  O
oxidative  O
stress  O
  O
and  O
significantly  O
altering  O
the  O
precorneal  O
mucins  O
.  O

In  O
vivo  O
  O
these  O
iatrogenic  O
effects  O
were  O
most  O
particularly  O
found  O
with  O
the  O
eye  O
drops  O
used  O
for  O
treating  O
long  O
-  O
term  O
pathologies  O
such  O
as  O
glaucoma  O
.  O

The  O
analysis  O
of  O
conjunctival  O
epithelium  O
using  O
flow  O
cytometry  O
(  O
FCM  O
)  O
showed  O
increased  O
human  O
leukocyte  O
antigen  O
(  O
HLA  O
)  O
DR  O
class  O
II  O
antigens  O
  O
interleukin  O
(  O
IL  O
)  O
synthesis  O
such  O
as  O
IL  O
-  O
6  O
  O
IL  O
-  O
8  O
  O
IL  O
-  O
10  O
  O
and  O
the  O
involvement  O
of  O
both  O
T  O
helper  O
(  O
Th  O
)  O
1  O
and  O
TH2  O
systems  O
through  O
the  O
overexpression  O
of  O
CC  O
chemokine  O
receptor  O
(  O
CCR  O
)  O
5  O
and  O
CCR4  O
in  O
the  O
conjunctiva  O
of  O
long  O
term  O
-  O
treated  O
glaucomatous  O
patients  O
.  O

Moreover  O
  O
BAK    B-Chemical
-  O
induced  O
conjunctival  O
fibrosis  O
is  O
considered  O
a  O
relevant  O
risk  O
factor  O
for  O
glaucoma  O
surgery  O
failure  O
.  O

Indeed  O
  O
several  O
papers  O
have  O
reported  O
that  O
the  O
efficacy  O
of  O
different  O
preservatives  O
including  O
BAK    B-Chemical
is  O
attenuated  O
when  O
incorporated  O
within  O
an  O
oil    B-Chemical
-  O
in  O
-  O
water    B-Chemical
emulsion  O
.  O

In  O
emulsions  O
  O
high  O
concentrations  O
of  O
antimicrobial  O
agents  O
were  O
needed  O
to  O
achieve  O
effective  O
preservative  O
activity  O
.  O

In  O
emulsion  O
  O
BAK    B-Chemical
partitioned  O
preferentially  O
in  O
the  O
oil  O
phase  O
  O
resulting  O
in  O
only  O
approximately  O
1  O
.  O
2  O
%  O
free  O
BAK    B-Chemical
in  O
solution  O
in  O
the  O
aqueous  O
phase  O
.  O

The  O
antimicrobial  O
activity  O
and  O
the  O
correlated  O
toxicity  O
are  O
driven  O
by  O
the  O
free  O
preservative  O
in  O
solution  O
whereas  O
the  O
emulsion  O
-  O
bound  O
preservative  O
seems  O
to  O
lose  O
its  O
efficacy  O
.  O

BAK    B-Chemical
is  O
composed  O
of  O
a  O
mixture  O
of  O
alkylbenzyldimethyl    B-Chemical
ammonium    I-Chemical
chlorides    I-Chemical
bearing  O
various  O
alkyl  O
chain  O
lengths  O
  O
each  O
one  O
with  O
a  O
different  O
water    B-Chemical
solubility  O
and  O
water    B-Chemical
-  O
octanol    B-Chemical
partition  O
coefficient  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
cationic  O
emulsions  O
in  O
ophthalmology  O
  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
QAC    B-Chemical
for  O
their  O
cationic  O
property  O
rather  O
than  O
their  O
preservative  O
effect  O
is  O
being  O
considered  O
.  O

We  O
suggested  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
lipophilic  O
cetalkonium    B-Chemical
chloride    I-Chemical
(  O
CKC    B-Chemical
)  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
longest  O
alkyl  O
-  O
chain  O
BAK    B-Chemical
components  O
  O
as  O
a  O
cationic  O
agent  O
in  O
ophthalmic  O
emulsions  O
.  O

With  O
a  O
highly  O
lipophilic  O
QAC    B-Chemical
  O
the  O
distribution  O
between  O
the  O
oil  O
and  O
aqueous  O
phases  O
of  O
the  O
emulsion  O
is  O
modified  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
affinity  O
toward  O
the  O
oil  O
phase  O
  O
further  O
favoring  O
the  O
cationic  O
agent  O
role  O
over  O
the  O
preservative  O
role  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
important  O
for  O
further  O
clinical  O
developments  O
to  O
study  O
the  O
toxicological  O
profiles  O
of  O
these  O
new  O
BAK    B-Chemical
or  O
CKC    B-Chemical
-  O
cationic  O
emulsions  O
and  O
to  O
compare  O
them  O
with  O
solutions  O
.  O

Over  O
the  O
past  O
few  O
years  O
  O
our  O
group  O
has  O
developed  O
new  O
in  O
vivo  O
tools  O
to  O
explore  O
the  O
ocular  O
surface  O
of  O
animal  O
models  O
.  O

In  O

confocal  O
microscopy  O
(  O
IVCM  O
)  O
offers  O
a  O
high  O
definition  O
of  O
histological  O
-  O
like  O
images  O
that  O
correspond  O
very  O
well  O
with  O
standard  O
immunohistology  O
of  O
healthy  O
and  O
pathological  O
conjunctivae  O
or  O
corneas  O
.  O

It  O
can  O
be  O
used  O
repeatedly  O
in  O
vivo  O
to  O
follow  O
a  O
disease  O
course  O
or  O
a  O
healing  O
process  O
.  O

Moreover  O
  O
the  O
evaluation  O
of  O
impression  O
cytology  O
(  O
IC  O
)  O
specimens  O
with  O
FCM  O
has  O
been  O
widely  O
used  O
to  O
detect  O
inflammation  O
  O
apoptosis  O
  O
or  O
TH1  O

in  O
patients  O
  O
in  O

DR  O
antigens  O
and  O
tumor  O

(  O
TNF  O
)-  O
related  O
markers  O
were  O
thus  O
found  O
to  O
be  O
involved  O
in  O
toxicological  O
or  O
inflammatory  O
pathways  O
of  O
the  O
ocular  O
surface  O
.  O

In  O
this  O
study  O
  O
we  O
combined  O
two  O
new  O
investigative  O
methods  O
(  O

and  O

)  O
in  O
correlation  O
with  O
standard  O
immunohistology  O
for  O
deep  O

and  O

to  O
assess  O
the  O
toxicological  O
effects  O
of  O
BAK    B-Chemical

on  O
the  O

of  O

We  O
chose  O
an  O
experimental  O

described  O
by  O

  O
consisting  O
of  O
15  O
successive  O
instillations  O
in  O

at  O

This  O
model  O
presents  O
the  O
advantages  O
of  O
inducing  O
a  O
toxic  O
injury  O
in  O
a  O
relatively  O

and  O
of  O
emphasizing  O
the  O

of  O
standard  O

only  O
be  O
assessed  O
over  O
the  O

in  O
standard  O

The  O
main  O

involved  O
is  O
that  O
cationic  O

In  O
an  O

  O
we  O
proposed  O
the  O
use  O
of  O

The  O
use  O
of  O
lipophilic  O
QAC    B-Chemical
  O
such  O
as  O
CKC    B-Chemical
rather  O
than  O
BAK    B-Chemical
  O
allows  O
obtaining  O
a  O

with  O
a  O

of  O
its  O

In  O
the  O
present  O
study  O
  O
we  O
studied  O
the  O
toxicity  O
of  O

compared  O
with  O
their  O

we  O
observed  O
a  O

This  O

In  O

this  O

also  O
clearly  O

the  O

as  O

  O
at  O

This  O
point  O
raises  O
the  O
problem  O
of  O
validating  O
reliable  O
tests  O
for  O
toxicological  O
purposes  O
and  O
may  O
explain  O
why  O
clinical  O

often  O
fail  O
to  O
show  O
mild  O

subclinical  O
toxic  O

that  O
are  O
observed  O
in  O
patients  O
treated  O
for  O
long  O
periods  O
of  O

  O
such  O
as  O
in  O
glaucomatous  O
patients  O
in  O
whom  O
the  O
ocular  O
surface  O
has  O
widely  O
shown  O
inflammatory  O
changes  O
and  O
clinical  O
impairment  O
.  O

Compared  O
to  O
the  O
previous  O
study  O
by  O
Ichijima  O
[  O
29  O
]  O
mainly  O
describing  O
the  O
effects  O
on  O
the  O
superficial  O
corneal  O
epithelium  O
  O
we  O
developed  O
new  O
in  O

tools  O
and  O
observed  O
the  O
entire  O
ocular  O
surface  O
  O
the  O
cornea  O
  O
the  O
limbus  O
  O
and  O
the  O
conjunctiva  O
  O
at  O
various  O
depths  O
.  O

Moreover  O
  O
we  O
studied  O
inflammatory  O
markers  O
in  O
conjunctival  O
imprints  O
and  O
confirmed  O
this  O
analysis  O
by  O
using  O
standard  O
immunohistology  O
after  O
animal  O
sacrifice  O
.  O

This  O
approach  O
provides  O
much  O
broader  O
and  O
more  O
reliable  O
information  O
than  O
clinical  O
assessment  O
alone  O
as  O
in  O
the  O
standard  O
Draize  O

or  O
even  O
in  O
investigations  O
at  O
the  O

conjunctival  O

may  O
not  O
be  O

Moreover  O
  O
this  O

  O
this  O
latter  O
formulation  O
being  O
almost  O
nontoxic  O
in  O
our  O
experimental  O
conditions  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
  O
when  O
formulated  O
in  O
an  O
emulsion  O
  O
both  O
BAK    B-Chemical
and  O
CKC    B-Chemical
presented  O
reduced  O
toxicity  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
same  O
concentration  O
in  O
solutions  O
.  O

This  O
reduction  O
of  O
toxicity  O
of  O
BAK    B-Chemical
/  O
CKC    B-Chemical
in  O
emulsion  O
is  O
attributed  O
to  O
the  O
distribution  O
of  O
the  O
QAC    B-Chemical
within  O
the  O
oil  O
phase  O
  O
leading  O
to  O
a  O
low  O
concentration  O
of  O
QAC    B-Chemical
in  O
the  O
aqueous  O
phase  O
.  O

One  O
of  O
the  O
proposed  O
mechanisms  O
of  O
QAC    B-Chemical
for  O
antimicrobial  O
activity  O
is  O
their  O
intercalation  O
within  O
the  O
bacterial  O
membrane  O
  O
in  O
emulsion  O
  O
they  O
behave  O
in  O
a  O
similar  O
way  O
by  O
distributing  O
at  O
the  O
emulsion  O
droplet  O
surface  O
.  O

We  O
therefore  O
suggest  O
that  O
the  O
QAC    B-Chemical
that  O
is  O
bound  O
to  O
the  O
emulsion  O
surface  O
is  O
not  O
available  O
for  O
binding  O
with  O
bacterial  O
membranes  O
and  O
that  O
only  O
the  O
remaining  O
free  O
QAC    B-Chemical
is  O
responsible  O
for  O
the  O
preservative  O
effect  O
and  O
the  O
toxicity  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
formulation  O
tested  O
in  O
the  O
present  O
study  O
  O
eventual  O
toxicity  O
was  O
reduced  O
not  O
only  O
by  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
cationic  O
emulsion  O
but  O
also  O
by  O
selecting  O
a  O
highly  O
lipophilic  O
QAC    B-Chemical
such  O
as  O
CKC    B-Chemical
to  O
improve  O
the  O
compound  O
partition  O
within  O
the  O
emulsion  O
.  O

The  O
lipophilicity  O
of  O
CKC    B-Chemical
partition  O
is  O
almost  O
100  O
-  O
fold  O
more  O
important  O
in  O
octanol    B-Chemical
than  O
in  O
water    B-Chemical
  O
which  O
is  O
four  O
to  O
five  O
times  O
higher  O
than  O
BAK    B-Chemical
.  O

Compared  O
to  O
BAK    B-Chemical
  O
CKC    B-Chemical
distributed  O
even  O
more  O
preferentially  O
into  O
the  O
oil  O
phase  O
(  O
allowing  O
reduced  O
cationic  O
agent  O
content  O
)  O
with  O
a  O
lesser  O
amount  O
dissolved  O
in  O
the  O
water    B-Chemical
phase  O
and  O
free  O
for  O
possible  O
toxic  O
damage  O
.  O

Moreover  O
  O
QAC    B-Chemical
could  O
enhance  O
membrane  O
fluidity  O
  O
and  O
CKC    B-Chemical
was  O
found  O
more  O
efficient  O
than  O
BAK    B-Chemical
.  O

In  O
our  O
experiments  O
  O
CKC    B-Chemical
Em  O
exhibited  O
almost  O
the  O
same  O
aspect  O
as  O
the  O
PBS    B-Chemical
-  O
instilled  O
group  O
and  O
did  O
not  O
induce  O
any  O
obvious  O
ocular  O
toxicity  O
during  O
all  O
the  O
observation  O
times  O
.  O

Consequently  O
  O
CKC    B-Chemical
-  O
associated  O
emulsions  O
present  O
the  O
advantages  O
of  O
cationic  O
emulsions  O
and  O
reduced  O
free  O
QAC    B-Chemical
and  O
demonstrated  O
no  O
obvious  O
toxicity  O
.  O

Pharmaceutical  O
companies  O
require  O
new  O
in  O

and  O
in  O

tools  O
to  O
test  O
the  O
possible  O
toxicity  O
of  O
their  O
newly  O
manufactured  O
drugs  O
.  O

In  O

tests  O
present  O
the  O
advantages  O
of  O
mimicking  O
the  O
real  O
ocular  O
environment  O
  O
especially  O
regarding  O
the  O
composition  O
of  O
the  O
lachrymal  O
film  O
and  O
drug  O
metabolism  O
in  O
ocular  O
tissues  O
.  O

At  O
the  O
same  O
time  O
  O
animal  O
experimentation  O
guidelines  O
require  O
refining  O
the  O
tests  O
to  O
reduce  O
the  O
number  O
of  O
animals  O
used  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
to  O
demonstrating  O
the  O
tolerance  O
of  O
emulsion  O
-  O
containing  O
eye  O
drops  O
  O
this  O
study  O
has  O
also  O
proved  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
possible  O
to  O
refine  O
the  O
classical  O
scoring  O
elaborated  O
by  O
Draize  O
test  O
  O
based  O
on  O
clinical  O
evaluations  O
in  O
1944  O
.  O

However  O
  O
as  O
the  O
gold  O
standard  O
in  O
ocular  O
toxicology  O
  O
it  O
lacks  O
precise  O
and  O
objective  O
criteria  O
  O
especially  O
at  O
cellular  O
levels  O
.  O

The  O
Draize  O
test  O
is  O
therefore  O
more  O
of  O
a  O
good  O
standard  O
for  O
eliminating  O
truly  O
toxic  O
drugs  O
in  O
a  O
screening  O
approach  O
than  O
in  O
a  O
predictive  O
evaluation  O
of  O
the  O
real  O
use  O
of  O
eye  O

in  O
further  O
clinical  O
development  O
.  O

We  O
developed  O
both  O
the  O
IVCM  O
and  O
flow  O

on  O
IC  O
for  O
our  O
toxicological  O
models  O
.  O

Used  O
in  O
combination  O
  O
each  O
of  O
these  O

to  O

the  O

of  O
the  O

as  O
well  O
as  O
the  O
surface  O
markers  O
expressed  O
by  O
conjunctival  O

in  O
toxic  O

.  O

Based  O
upon  O
histological  O

patterns  O
of  O
the  O
ocular  O
surface  O
for  O
three  O

  O
IVCM  O
offers  O
the  O
advantage  O
of  O
examining  O
the  O
same  O
animal  O
in  O

during  O
experimental  O
procedures  O
and  O
could  O
not  O
be  O
replaced  O
with  O
any  O
other  O
standardized  O
method  O
except  O
histology  O
after  O
sacrifice  O
  O
which  O
would  O
have  O
required  O
a  O
much  O
higher  O
number  O
of  O
animals  O
to  O
provide  O
successive  O
time  O
points  O
.  O

Moreover  O
  O
specifically  O
in  O
the  O
rabbit  O
model  O
  O
IVCM  O
also  O
allows  O
us  O
to  O
explore  O
the  O
limbus  O
and  O
conjunctiva  O
blood  O

that  O
are  O
difficult  O
to  O
see  O
in  O
small  O
eyes  O
such  O
as  O
rat  O
eyes  O
.  O

The  O
IVCM  O
scale  O
could  O
also  O
provide  O
a  O
classification  O
of  O
global  O

in  O
the  O

  O
and  O
conjunctiva  O
.  O

This  O

could  O
be  O
used  O
as  O
an  O
effective  O
tool  O
for  O
evaluating  O
ocular  O

in  O
a  O

in  O
many  O

usefully  O

the  O

IC  O

were  O
evaluated  O
using  O
a  O

to  O
identify  O
the  O
different  O

in  O
the  O

then  O
using  O
FCM  O
to  O
assess  O
the  O
levels  O
of  O

.  O

Thus  O
  O
IC  O

were  O
also  O
efficient  O
ex  O

tools  O
for  O

In  O
our  O

In  O
this  O

  O
we  O
proposed  O
a  O

in  O
all  O

this  O

is  O
more  O
pertinent  O
  O

reliable  O
than  O
if  O
those  O

were  O
used  O
individually  O

We  O
also  O

that  O

Introduction  O

Uveal  O
melanoma  O
(  O
UM  O
)  O
is  O
the  O
most  O
common  O
primary  O
intraocular  O
tumor  O
in  O
the  O
adult  O
population  O
.  O

Although  O
significant  O
advances  O
have  O
been  O
made  O
in  O
the  O
ability  O
to  O
diagnose  O
and  O
treat  O
primary  O
tumors  O
of  O
UM  O
  O
the  O
mortality  O
rates  O
for  O
UM  O
have  O
changed  O
little  O
during  O
the  O
past  O
few  O
decades  O
.  O

Because  O
metastatic  O
disease  O
can  O
appear  O
as  O
late  O
as  O
12  O
to  O
15  O
years  O
after  O
enucleation  O
of  O
the  O
ocular  O
melanoma  O
  O
the  O
disease  O
is  O
likely  O
to  O
have  O
already  O
disseminated  O
at  O
the  O
time  O
of  O
diagnosis  O
  O
either  O
as  O
circulating  O
malignant  O
cells  O
or  O
as  O
occult  O
micrometastatic  O
lesions  O
.  O

UMs  O
metastasize  O
preferentially  O
to  O
the  O
liver  O
  O
and  O
the  O
average  O
survival  O
period  O
for  O
UM  O
is  O
less  O
than  O
one  O
year  O
after  O
clinical  O
diagnosis  O
of  O
the  O
lesions  O
.  O

Little  O
is  O
known  O
about  O
the  O
molecular  O
mechanisms  O
underlying  O
the  O
metastatic  O
potential  O
of  O
UM  O
.  O

Although  O
UMs  O
and  O
cutaneous  O
melanomas  O
(  O
CM  O
)  O
are  O
of  O
similar  O
embryological  O
origin  O
and  O
as  O
such  O
share  O
several  O
common  O
features  O
including  O
morphology  O
and  O
the  O
properties  O
of  O
the  O
melanogenesis  O
pathway  O
  O
they  O
differ  O
significantly  O
in  O
their  O
epidemiological  O
  O
cytogenetic  O
  O
and  O
immunological  O
characteristics  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
biologic  O
behavior  O
.  O

UMs  O
almost  O
exclusively  O
metastasizes  O
through  O
the  O
blood  O
and  O
preferentially  O
to  O
the  O
liver  O
  O
whereas  O
CMs  O
are  O
capable  O
of  O
both  O
lymphatic  O
and  O
hematogenous  O
(  O
often  O
less  O
organ  O
-  O
specific  O
)  O
spread  O
to  O
almost  O
any  O
organ  O
in  O
the  O
body  O
.  O

Early  O
events  O
in  O
the  O
formation  O
of  O
metastases  O
include  O
the  O
escape  O
of  O
tumor  O
cells  O
from  O
the  O
primary  O
tumor  O
site  O
followed  O
by  O
invasion  O
into  O
the  O
surrounding  O
stroma  O
  O
these  O
events  O
depend  O
on  O
the  O
interaction  O
of  O
tumor  O
cells  O
with  O
the  O
extracellular  O
matrix  O
(  O
ECM  O
).  O

Recently  O
we  O
showed  O
that  O
primary  O
UMs  O
and  O
primary  O
CMs  O
also  O
differ  O
in  O
their  O
adhesion  O
to  O
selected  O
components  O
of  O
the  O
ECM  O
  O
including  O
fibronectin  O
(  O
FN  O
)  O
laminin  O
  O
and  O
type  O
IV  O
collagen  O
.  O

Successful  O
metastasis  O
requires  O
an  O
ordered  O
series  O
of  O
steps  O
  O
including  O
detachment  O
of  O
tumor  O
cells  O
from  O
the  O
primary  O
neoplasm  O
  O
invasion  O
into  O
and  O
migration  O
through  O
ECM  O
  O
entry  O
into  O
blood  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
lymph  O
vessels  O
  O
transport  O
along  O
the  O
circulatory  O
system  O
  O
adhesion  O
to  O
the  O
endothelium  O
  O
extravasation  O
  O
and  O
outgrowth  O
in  O
a  O
distant  O
organ  O
.  O

Receptors  O
that  O
mediate  O
cell  O
-  O
cell  O
and  O
cell  O
-  O
ECM  O
adhesion  O
have  O
been  O
shown  O
to  O
be  O
key  O
components  O
in  O
the  O
metastatic  O
cascade  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
reported  O
that  O
during  O
the  O
progression  O
of  O
malignant  O
CM  O
  O
the  O
expression  O
profiles  O
of  O
several  O
adhesion  O
molecules  O
undergo  O
changes  O
which  O
are  O
directly  O
or  O
inversely  O
correlated  O
with  O
its  O
metastatic  O
potential  O
.  O

Loss  O
  O
overexpression  O
or  O
malfunctioning  O
of  O
adhesion  O
molecules  O
may  O
contribute  O
to  O
the  O
detachment  O
of  O
tumor  O
cells  O
from  O
the  O
primary  O
tumor  O
  O
local  O
invasion  O
and  O
metastasis  O
.  O

Among  O

  O
integrins  O
are  O

In  O

we  O
used  O

the  O

probably  O
was  O
enough  O

Most  O

The  O

which  O
they  O
are  O

or  O
as  O
the  O

not  O
fully  O

Discussion  O

Many  O
studies  O
have  O
shown  O
tumor  O
cells  O
to  O
be  O
generally  O
less  O
adhesive  O
and  O
to  O
deposit  O
less  O
ECM  O
than  O
their  O
normal  O
counterparts  O
.  O

The  O
loosened  O
matrix  O
adhesion  O
of  O
tumor  O
cells  O
may  O
permit  O
them  O
to  O
leave  O
their  O
original  O
site  O
in  O
the  O
tissue  O
.  O

Previously  O
we  O
demonstrated  O
that  O
although  O
both  O
CM  O
and  O
UM  O
are  O
similarly  O
derived  O
from  O
neuroectodermal  O
tissues  O
  O
they  O
differ  O
in  O
their  O
adhesion  O
to  O
type  O
IV  O
collagen  O
  O
laminin  O
and  O
FN  O
.  O

To  O
study  O
the  O
biologic  O
mechanisms  O
that  O
underlie  O
this  O
distinctive  O
biologic  O
behavior  O
  O
we  O
investigated  O
the  O
influence  O
of  O
the  O
surface  O
expression  O
of  O
the  O
integrins  O
that  O
act  O
as  O
FN  O
receptors  O
  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
the  O
expression  O
of  O

and  O

)  O
cell  O
behavior  O
.  O

In  O
this  O
study  O
we  O
showed  O
that  O
the  O
UM  O
cells  O
did  O
not  O
adhere  O
to  O
FN  O
and  O
that  O
they  O
repaired  O
wounds  O
twice  O
as  O
fast  O
as  O
CM  O
cells  O
did  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
well  O
documented  O
in  O
the  O
literature  O
that  O
the  O
expression  O
pattern  O
of  O
adhesive  O
molecules  O
differs  O
widely  O
between  O
normal  O
and  O
malignant  O
tissues  O
.  O

The  O
gain  O
or  O
loss  O
of  O
adhesive  O
molecule  O
expression  O
on  O
cancer  O
cells  O
appears  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
natural  O
consequence  O
of  O
their  O
adaptation  O
and  O
survival  O
in  O
a  O
different  O
environment  O
.  O

Integrins  O
  O
which  O
are  O
the  O
major  O
class  O
of  O
adhesion  O
molecules  O
responsible  O
for  O
mediating  O
cellular  O
interaction  O
with  O
the  O
ECM  O
  O
seem  O
to  O
have  O
an  O
important  O
role  O
in  O
various  O
aspects  O
of  O
cancer  O
development  O
.  O

Several  O
studies  O
have  O
focused  O
on  O
the  O
integrin  O
expression  O
of  O
melanoma  O
cells  O
  O
but  O
only  O
the  O
expression  O
of  O
α2β1  O
  O
α3β1  O
  O
α6β1  O
and  O
αvβ3  O
integrins  O
was  O
found  O
to  O
be  O
associated  O
with  O
tumor  O
progression  O
in  O
CMs  O
.  O

No  O
correlation  O
between  O
integrin  O
expression  O
and  O
cell  O
type  O
or  O
aggressive  O
behavior  O
has  O
been  O
has  O
been  O
confirmed  O
in  O
UM  O
.  O

The  O
present  O
study  O
found  O
no  O
distinct  O
pattern  O
of  O
FN  O
receptor  O
expression  O
among  O
primary  O
UMs  O
and  O
CMs  O
  O
except  O
for  O
high  O
expression  O
of  O
α4β1  O
integrin  O
on  O
both  O
FM55P  O
and  O
IGR  O
-  O
39  O
cells  O
.  O

Contrasting  O
with  O
our  O
results  O
showing  O
a  O
high  O
level  O
of  O
α4β1  O
integrin  O
on  O
CM  O
cells  O
are  O
previous  O
findings  O
that  O
α4β1  O
integrin  O
expression  O
was  O
rare  O
in  O
CM  O
.  O

The  O
divergent  O
outcomes  O
may  O
be  O
attributable  O
to  O
differences  O
in  O
the  O
techniques  O
and  O
antibodies  O
used  O
.  O

The  O
high  O
levels  O
of  O
α3β1  O
  O
α4β1  O
  O
and  O
α5β1  O
integrin  O
expression  O
on  O
IGR  O
-  O
39  O
cells  O
seemed  O
to  O
be  O
associated  O
with  O
their  O
strong  O
adhesion  O
to  O
FN  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
  O
92  O
–  O
1  O
  O
Mel202  O
  O
and  O
FM55P  O
cells  O
showed  O
no  O
or  O
weak  O
adhesion  O
to  O
FN  O
  O
perhaps  O
the  O
result  O
of  O
low  O
expression  O
of  O
FN  O
receptors  O
except  O
for  O
that  O
of  O
α4β1  O
integrin  O
on  O
FM55P  O
cells  O
.  O

The  O
high  O
expression  O
of  O
α4β1  O
integrin  O
on  O
FM55P  O
cells  O
probably  O
was  O
enough  O
to  O
make  O
them  O
adhere  O
weakly  O
to  O
FN  O
.  O

These  O
results  O
were  O
further  O
confirmed  O
by  O
assays  O
of  O
adhesion  O
inhibition  O
in  O
the  O
presence  O
of  O
specific  O
anti  O
-  O
integrin  O
monoclonal  O
antibodies  O
(  O
data  O
not  O
shown  O
).  O

There  O
is  O
increasing  O
evidence  O
that  O
progression  O
of  O
cancer  O
from  O
a  O
tumorigenic  O
to  O
metastatic  O
phenotype  O
is  O
directly  O
associated  O
with  O
an  O

as  O
the  O
result  O
of  O

of  O

.  O

Perhaps  O
the  O
most  O
interesting  O
findings  O
of  O
this  O
study  O
are  O
those  O
related  O
to  O
the  O

not  O

  O
but  O
it  O
has  O
been  O
associated  O
with  O
several  O

of  O

:  O
decreased  O

  O

  O
increased  O

in  O

.  O

We  O
recently  O

that  O

in  O
the  O
number  O
of  O
proteins  O
acting  O
as  O
substrates  O
for  O

were  O

than  O
with  O

.  O

It  O
is  O
believed  O
that  O

oligosaccharides    I-Chemical
on  O

facilitate  O
the  O

to  O
enhance  O

Here  O
we  O
provided  O

that  O

How  O
is  O
the  O
effect  O
of  O
the  O
sugar    B-Chemical

achieved  O
?  O

Cell  O
migration  O
is  O
influenced  O
by  O
the  O
strength  O
of  O
transient  O
cell  O
-  O
substratum  O
attachment  O
and  O
depends  O
on  O
ligand  O
and  O
integrin  O
levels  O
  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
integrin  O
-  O
ligand  O
binding  O
affinities  O
.  O

Cell  O
migration  O
is  O
most  O
rapid  O
at  O
an  O
intermediate  O
ratio  O
of  O
cell  O
-  O
substratum  O
adhesion  O
to  O
contractile  O
force  O
  O
then  O
the  O
cell  O
can  O
still  O
extend  O
lamellae  O
and  O
form  O
new  O
attachments  O
at  O
the  O
cell  O
front  O
but  O
break  O
the  O
attachment  O
at  O
the  O

.  O

In  O
92  O

1  O
  O
Mel202  O
  O
and  O
FM55P  O
cells  O
  O
altered  O
surface  O
glycosylation  O
might  O
induce  O
functional  O
changes  O
in  O
adhesion  O
proteins  O
and  O
in  O
this  O
way  O
decrease  O
the  O
binding  O
capacity  O
of  O
integrins  O
to  O
FN  O
  O
possibly  O
by  O
holding  O
the  O
conformation  O
in  O
the  O
low  O

affinity  O
form  O
to  O
the  O
ligand  O
.  O

Indeed  O
  O
studies  O
with  O
tri  O
-  O
and  O
tetraantennary  O
minimal  O
energy  O
conformers  O
indicate  O
that  O
the  O
β1  O
–  O
6  O
branch  O
is  O
folded  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
protein  O
structure  O
  O
and  O
this  O
in  O
turn  O
could  O
likely  O
modulate  O
the  O
integrin  O
conformation  O
  O
and  O
thus  O
also  O
integrin  O
function  O
(  O
affinity  O
).  O

It  O
has  O
also  O
been  O
shown  O
that  O

may  O
reduce  O
the  O

of  O

aggregates  O
that  O
maintain  O
firm  O
cell  O

  O
and  O
thereby  O
facilitate  O
cell  O
motility  O
.  O

From  O
flow  O
cytometric  O
studies  O
it  O
is  O
known  O
that  O
92  O

possess  O
more  O

than  O
do  O

  O
so  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
surprising  O
that  O
92  O

seemed  O
more  O

Possibly  O
the  O

a  O

it  O

Nevertheless  O
  O
it  O
should  O
be  O

that  O

Although  O
little  O
is  O
known  O
about  O
the  O

Moreover  O
  O
it  O
has  O
been  O
shown  O
that  O
the  O

In  O
addition  O

Substitution  O
by  O

effectively  O
reduces  O

because  O

Although  O
it  O

It  O

that  O
the  O

Background  O

NMDA  O

in  O
the  O

and  O

These  O

consist  O
of  O
two  O

The  O

therefore  O

Discussion  O

We  O

expressed  O
by  O
two  O
populations  O
of  O
dorsal  O

and  O
NK1R  O

Based  O
on  O
our  O
experiments  O
  O
both  O
highly  O

(  O

and  O
poorly  O
Mg2    B-Chemical

(  O
NR2C  O
/  O
D  O
)  O
NMDA  O
receptors  O
are  O
expressed  O
by  O
NK1R  O
+  O
neurons  O
.  O

NR2C  O

D  O

are  O
less  O
strongly  O
expressed  O
by  O
NK1R  O

and  O
therefore  O
the  O
NR2A  O

B  O

subtypes  O
dominate  O
more  O
strongly  O

for  O

in  O
our  O

on  O

show  O

Previous  O
reports  O
indicate  O
that  O
NMDA  O

with  O

are  O

in  O

.  O

Our  O
observations  O
show  O
strong  O
evidence  O
of  O
NR2A  O
and  O
/  O
or  O
NR2B  O
expression  O
in  O
both  O
NK1R  O
+  O
and  O
NK1R  O

lamina  O

.  O

Earlier  O
studies  O
suggest  O
that  O
NR2D  O
mRNA  O
is  O
expressed  O
by  O
many  O
and  O
NR2C  O
mRNA  O
by  O
few  O
dorsal  O
horn  O
neurons  O
[  O
34  O
].  O

In  O
addition  O
  O
more  O
NR2D  O
mRNA  O
is  O
expressed  O
in  O
adult  O
dorsal  O
horn  O
and  O
embryonic  O
spinal  O
cord  O
than  O
NR2C  O
mRNA  O
[  O

  O
37  O
  O
38  O
].  O

Further  O
support  O
for  O
the  O
presence  O
of  O
NR2D  O
is  O
that  O
NMDA  O
receptors  O
with  O
NR2D  O
-  O
like  O
single  O
channel  O
conductance  O
have  O
been  O
reported  O
for  O
lamina  O
II  O
neurons  O
in  O
rat  O
dorsal  O
horn  O
[  O
39  O
  O
40  O
].  O

Based  O
on  O
our  O
experiments  O
  O
we  O
have  O
found  O
that  O
NK1R  O
+  O
neurons  O
express  O
NR2C  O
/  O
D  O
subunits  O
more  O
strongly  O
than  O
the  O
NK1R  O
-  O
neurons  O
.  O

While  O
it  O
remains  O
uncertain  O
which  O
NMDA  O
receptors  O
with  O
low  O
Mg2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
sensitivity  O
are  O
expressed  O
by  O
these  O
lamina  O
I  O
neurons  O
  O
NR2D  O
is  O
the  O
best  O
candidate  O
.  O

NK1R  O
+  O
lamina  O
I  O
neurons  O
represent  O
a  O
comparatively  O
uniform  O
population  O
of  O
neurons  O
that  O
are  O
predominantly  O
projection  O
neurons  O
[  O
21  O
].  O

The  O
NK1R  O
-  O
neuron  O
population  O
is  O
heterogeneous  O
  O
including  O
inhibitory  O
and  O
excitatory  O
interneurons  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
a  O
small  O
population  O
of  O
NK1R  O
-  O
projection  O
neurons  O
[  O
41  O
].  O

Within  O
the  O
NK1R  O
-  O
population  O
of  O
neurons  O
  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
variability  O
of  O
NR2  O
subunit  O
identity  O
may  O
represent  O
different  O
receptor  O
configurations  O
on  O
different  O
subpopulations  O
of  O
dorsal  O
horn  O
neurons  O
.  O

At  O
the  O
whole  O
cell  O
level  O
  O
particularly  O
for  O
NK1R  O
+  O
neurons  O
  O
we  O
have  O
evidence  O
that  O
NMDA  O
receptors  O
with  O
NR2C  O
/  O
D  O
subunits  O
are  O
present  O
.  O

NMDA  O
receptors  O
with  O
these  O
less  O
Mg2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
sensitive  O
NR2  O
subunits  O
could  O
be  O
expressed  O
at  O
synapses  O
  O
extrasynaptically  O
or  O
both  O
.  O

Momiyama  O
(  O
2000  O
)  O
has  O
suggested  O
an  O
extrasynaptic  O
localization  O
of  O
NR2D  O
containing  O
NMDA  O
receptors  O
by  O
lamina  O
II  O
neurons  O
in  O
the  O
dorsal  O
horn  O
.  O

Because  O
of  O
their  O
higher  O
binding  O
affinity  O
with  O
glutamate    B-Chemical
  O
these  O
extrasynaptic  O
receptors  O
may  O
be  O
more  O
sensitive  O
to  O
ambient  O
glutamate    B-Chemical
levels  O
in  O
the  O
extracellular  O
space  O
that  O
could  O
accumulate  O
due  O
to  O
glial  O
release  O
[  O
42  O
  O
43  O
]  O
spill  O
over  O
associated  O
with  O
high  O
amounts  O
of  O
activity  O
  O
and  O
to  O
injury  O
[  O
44  O
].  O

Activation  O
of  O
these  O
receptors  O
would  O
be  O
expected  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
potent  O
impact  O
on  O
neuronal  O
cell  O
function  O
due  O
to  O
their  O
lowered  O
Mg2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
sensitivity  O
  O
prolonged  O
time  O
over  O
which  O
they  O
open  O
following  O
glutamate    B-Chemical
binding  O
  O
and  O
lack  O
of  O
desensitization  O

Other  O
factors  O
that  O
could  O
influence  O

ratio  O

One  O
concern  O
with  O
our  O
approach  O
to  O
NR2  O
subunit  O
identification  O
is  O
the  O
possibility  O
that  O
changes  O
in  O
membrane  O
currents  O
secondary  O
to  O
NMDA  O
receptor  O
activation  O
will  O
alter  O
the  O
g  O
(-  O
90  O
mV  O
)/  O
g  O
(  O
MIC  O

It  O
is  O
because  O
of  O
this  O
concern  O
that  O
we  O
have  O
recorded  O
in  O
low  O
Ca2    B-Chemical

solution  O
with  O
added  O
Ba2    B-Chemical

limited  O
our  O

no  O

)  O
while  O
NMDA    B-Chemical
washes  O
on  O
and  O
off  O
the  O
spinal  O
cord  O

.  O

Even  O
more  O
importantly  O
  O
we  O
have  O
used  O
pharmacological  O
tools  O
as  O
an  O
independent  O
test  O
of  O

these  O

For  O
the  O

that  O
met  O
the  O
criteria  O
for  O
our  O
study  O
  O
we  O
have  O
confirmed  O

the  O

Significance  O

We  O
have  O
taken  O
advantage  O
of  O
the  O
Mg2    B-Chemical

to  O
identify  O

subpopulations  O
of  O

and  O
confirmed  O
this  O
with  O

We  O
show  O
that  O
individual  O
neurons  O
express  O
NMDA  O

with  O
different  O

at  O
different  O
ratios  O

NR2D  O
has  O
been  O

to  O
have  O
a  O
role  O

In  O
this  O

  O

Introduction  O

Transcription  O
factors  O
have  O
been  O
shown  O
to  O
play  O
an  O
important  O
role  O
not  O
only  O
in  O
the  O
biology  O
of  O
photoreceptors  O
and  O
other  O
retinal  O
cells  O
  O
but  O
also  O
as  O
sites  O
of  O
mutations  O
causing  O
degenerative  O
disease  O
.  O

For  O
example  O
  O
mutations  O
in  O
CRX  O
and  O
NRL  O
cause  O
various  O
forms  O
of  O
progressive  O
retinal  O
dystrophies  O
[  O

The  O
SP  O
family  O
of  O
transcription  O
factors  O
(  O
SP1  O
-  O
5  O
)  O
is  O
formed  O
by  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
proteins  O
that  O
selectively  O
bind  O
to  O
the  O

GC  O
box  O

in  O
the  O
promoter  O
region  O
of  O
many  O
genes  O
[  O
5  O
-  O
7  O
]  O
via  O
three  O
putative  O
zinc  O
finger  O
domains  O
of  O
the  O
C2H2  O
type  O
[  O

].  O

Based  O
on  O
sequence  O
similarities  O
  O
SP1  O
  O
SP3  O
  O
and  O
SP4  O
are  O
more  O
closely  O
related  O
to  O
each  O
other  O
than  O
to  O
SP2  O
and  O
SP5  O
[  O
6  O
  O
9  O
]  O
and  O
the  O
three  O
have  O
similar  O
affinity  O
for  O
the  O
GC  O
box  O
[  O
10  O
  O
11  O
].  O

While  O
SP1  O
and  O
SP3  O
are  O
ubiquitously  O
expressed  O
  O
SP4  O
is  O
most  O
abundant  O
in  O
the  O
developing  O
nervous  O
system  O
  O
particularly  O
in  O
the  O
hippocampus  O
[  O
12  O
]  O
and  O
retina  O
[  O
13  O
]  O
although  O
it  O
is  O
also  O
expressed  O
in  O
other  O
tissues  O
[  O

  O

].  O

Sp1  O
and  O
Sp3  O
knockout  O
mice  O
all  O
die  O
after  O
E10  O
or  O
at  O
birth  O
  O
respectively  O
.  O

Sp4  O
knockout  O
mice  O
appear  O
to  O
develop  O
normally  O
to  O
birth  O
  O
but  O
after  O
birth  O
  O
many  O
pups  O
die  O
by  O
P28  O
and  O
those  O
that  O
survive  O
are  O
small  O
and  O
have  O
other  O
abnormalities  O
[  O
12  O
].  O

In  O
the  O
last  O
few  O
years  O
  O
we  O
have  O
studied  O
extensively  O
the  O
SP4  O
transcription  O
factor  O
and  O
have  O
found  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
present  O
in  O
all  O
retinal  O
layers  O
  O
interacts  O
with  O
CRX  O
and  O
NRL  O
and  O
activates  O
transcription  O
of  O
several  O
rod  O
specific  O
genes  O
including  O
PDE6B  O
and  O
RHO  O
  O
encoding  O
the  O
β  O
-  O
subunit  O
of  O
cGMP  O
-  O
phosphodiesterase  O
(  O
β  O
-  O
PDE  O
)  O
and  O
rod  O
opsin  O
  O
respectively  O
[  O
13  O
  O
15  O
  O
16  O
].  O

Because  O
of  O
its  O
specific  O
involvement  O
in  O
transcription  O
of  O
rod  O
genes  O
and  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
history  O
of  O
transcription  O
factor  O
mutations  O
causing  O
retinal  O
degeneration  O
  O
we  O
considered  O
SP4  O
a  O
good  O
candidate  O
gene  O
to  O
screen  O
for  O
missense  O
mutations  O
in  O
patients  O
with  O
various  O
forms  O
of  O
retinal  O
degeneration  O
.  O

To  O
this  O
end  O
  O
we  O
screened  O
the  O
6  O
exons  O
of  O
the  O
SP4  O
gene  O
in  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
270  O
patients  O
with  O
various  O
forms  O
of  O
retinal  O
degeneration  O
that  O
had  O
been  O
screened  O
previously  O
for  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
photoreceptor  O
genes  O
[  O
17  O
-  O
21  O
].  O

Although  O
we  O
could  O
not  O
establish  O
that  O
mutations  O
in  O
the  O
SP4  O
gene  O
cause  O
retinal  O
degenerative  O
disease  O
  O
neither  O
could  O
we  O
rule  O
this  O
possibility  O
out  O
because  O
the  O
families  O
of  O
two  O
patients  O
in  O
which  O
an  O
SP4  O
missense  O
mutation  O
and  O
a  O
GNB1  O
intron  O
2  O
variant  O
were  O
present  O
  O
segregated  O
with  O
disease  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
  O
the  O
inherited  O
retinal  O
degeneration  O
of  O
the  O
Rd4  O
mouse  O
is  O
caused  O
by  O
an  O
inversion  O
of  O
mouse  O
chromosome  O
4  O
  O
and  O
the  O
site  O
of  O
the  O
telomeric  O
breakpoint  O
is  O
precisely  O
on  O

of  O
the  O

(  O

In  O
each  O
of  O
the  O
three  O
families  O
where  O
the  O
Asn306Ser    B-Chemical

did  O
not  O
segregate  O
with  O
disease  O
  O
two  O

alleles  O
in  O

may  O
have  O
rendered  O
the  O
presence  O
of  O
the  O
heterozygous  O
Asn306Ser    B-Chemical
coincidental  O
and  O
unrelated  O
to  O
disease  O
.  O

However  O
  O
this  O
does  O
not  O
rule  O
out  O
the  O
possibility  O
that  O
two  O
Asn306Ser    B-Chemical
alleles  O
could  O
cause  O
disease  O
.  O

(  O

)  O
For  O
the  O
two  O
families  O
where  O
only  O
the  O
affecteds  O
carried  O
both  O
the  O
Asn306Ser    B-Chemical
allele  O
and  O
the  O
GNB1  O
variant  O

allele  O
  O
pathogenesis  O
is  O
possible  O
at  O
least  O
genetically  O
.  O

Furthermore  O
  O
GNB1  O
has  O
three  O
GC  O
boxes  O
in  O
its  O
promoter  O
and  O
SP4  O
interacts  O
with  O
GC  O
boxes  O
.  O

Thus  O
  O
digenic  O
disease  O
may  O
be  O
plausible  O
.  O

To  O
answer  O
the  O
question  O
of  O
pathogenicity  O
of  O
Asn306Ser    B-Chemical
  O
functional  O
assays  O
of  O
the  O
protein  O
carrying  O
this  O
variant  O
would  O
have  O
to  O
be  O
conducted  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
  O
the  O
possibility  O
that  O
Asn306Ser    B-Chemical
may  O
be  O
pathogenic  O
is  O
supported  O
by  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
Asn306Ser    B-Chemical
is  O
in  O
the  O
transactivation  O
domain  O
of  O
the  O
SP4  O
protein  O
and  O
in  O
one  O
of  O
six  O
glycosylation  O
sites  O

S  O

Changing  O
asparagine    B-Chemical
to  O
serine    B-Chemical
eliminates  O
this  O
site  O
of  O
posttranslational  O
modification  O
and  O
this  O
may  O
affect  O
the  O
function  O
of  O
the  O
protein  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
  O
at  O
position  O
306  O
there  O
is  O
an  O
asparagine    B-Chemical
only  O
in  O
the  O

while  O
in  O
the  O
mouse  O
  O
rat  O
  O
dog  O
and  O
cow  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
threonine    B-Chemical

Therefore  O
  O

With  O

to  O
be  O

determine  O
if  O
this  O

However  O
  O
the  O

do  O
not  O
correspond  O

Another  O
possibility  O
is  O
that  O
the  O
A  O

would  O
disrupt  O
an  O
enhancer  O
or  O
a  O

causing  O
altered  O
expression  O
of  O
the  O

Although  O
there  O
is  O
no  O
direct  O
evidence  O
that  O
the  O
Asn306Ser    B-Chemical
mutation  O
in  O
the  O
SP4  O
gene  O
and  O
the  O
intron  O

together  O
are  O
responsible  O
for  O

in  O
the  O

individuals  O
  O
digenic  O

cannot  O
be  O
ruled  O
out  O
without  O
further  O
testing  O
the  O
pathogenicity  O
of  O
the  O

It  O
is  O
certainly  O
plausible  O
that  O
the  O
protein  O
products  O
of  O
a  O
phototransduction  O
gene  O
like  O
GNB1  O
and  O
a  O
transcription  O
factor  O
that  O
may  O
influence  O
its  O
expression  O

can  O
together  O
cause  O

  O
the  O

a  O

a  O

more  O

that  O
from  O

(  O

The  O
protein  O

may  O
be  O
affected  O
by  O
several  O
factors  O
  O
including  O
breed  O
  O
environmental  O
temperature  O
  O
diseases  O
  O
and  O
stage  O
of  O

  O
parity  O
and  O
nutrition  O
[  O
16  O
].  O

In  O
general  O
  O
high  O
environmental  O
temperature  O
reduces  O
the  O
total  O
protein  O
content  O
of  O
milk  O
[  O
17  O
]  O
so  O
the  O
protein  O
content  O
of  O
cow  O
milk  O
was  O
higher  O
during  O
winters  O
than  O
during  O
summers  O
[  O
16  O
].  O

However  O
  O
several  O
papers  O
have  O
reported  O
that  O
energy  O
intake  O
(  O
except  O
fats  O
and  O
oils  O
)  O
may  O
have  O
a  O
positive  O
effect  O
on  O
milk  O
protein  O

[  O
18  O

20  O
].  O

In  O
the  O
Qinghai  O

Tibet  O
Plateau  O
  O
grass  O
and  O

cannot  O
survive  O
in  O
a  O
very  O
cold  O
winter  O
.  O

For  O
natural  O
grazing  O
yaks  O
  O
the  O
malnutrition  O
of  O
feeds  O
resulted  O
in  O
lower  O
TN  O
in  O
winter  O
.  O

Similarly  O
  O
Walley  O
et  O
al  O
.  O

[  O
21  O
]  O
demonstrated  O
that  O
the  O
total  O
protein  O
content  O
of  O
milk  O
was  O
lowest  O
when  O
the  O
energy  O
intake  O
of  O
the  O
cow  O
was  O
retarded  O
.  O

The  O
NPN  O
contents  O
of  O

milk  O
were  O

%  O
and  O
0  O
.  O
4  O
%  O
respectively  O
in  O
warm  O
and  O
cold  O
seasons  O
.  O

The  O
NPN  O
constituted  O
5  O
.  O
56  O
%  O
and  O
5  O
.  O
30  O
%  O
of  O
the  O
total  O
N    B-Chemical
in  O
the  O
yak  O
milk  O
  O
which  O
did  O
not  O
vary  O
much  O
between  O
seasons  O
  O
and  O
that  O
the  O
NPN  O
proportion  O
was  O
consistent  O
with  O
that  O
of  O
cow  O
’  O
s  O
milk  O
[  O
16  O
].  O

The  O
reason  O
of  O
above  O
results  O
is  O
that  O
the  O
NPN  O
content  O
of  O
milk  O
is  O
less  O
variable  O
among  O
breeds  O
  O
and  O
the  O
changes  O
of  O
milk  O
NPN  O
content  O
with  O
environmental  O
temperature  O
are  O
similar  O
in  O
pattern  O
to  O
changes  O
in  O
protein  O
content  O
[  O
16  O
].  O

The  O
contents  O
of  O
the  O
whey  O
protein  O
nitrogen    B-Chemical
(  O
WPN  O
)  O
did  O
not  O
change  O
significantly  O
between  O
cold  O
and  O
warm  O
seasons  O
.  O

The  O
average  O
WPN  O
/  O
TN  O
of  O
the  O
yak  O
milk  O
was  O
19  O
.  O
63  O
%  O
which  O
was  O
higher  O
than  O
that  O
of  O
cow  O
milk  O
[  O
16  O
]  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
similar  O
to  O
that  O
of  O
sheep  O
milk  O
[  O
22  O
].  O

The  O
average  O
value  O
of  O
α  O
-  O
lactalbumin  O
and  O
β  O
-  O
lactoglobulin  O
as  O
a  O
percentage  O
of  O
whey  O
protein  O
was  O
upwards  O
of  O
66  O
%  O
which  O
was  O
lower  O
than  O
that  O
of  O
cow  O
whey  O
protein  O
[  O
23  O
].  O

The  O
value  O
found  O
for  O
α  O
-  O
lactalbumin  O
is  O
puzzling  O
because  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
in  O
line  O
with  O
the  O
usual  O
relationship  O
between  O
lactose    B-Chemical
and  O
α  O
-  O
lactalbumin  O
contents  O
in  O
mammalian  O
milks  O
.  O

Indeed  O
  O
α  O
-  O
lactalbumin  O
is  O
half  O
of  O
the  O
lactose    B-Chemical
synthetase  O
enzyme  O
and  O
its  O
content  O
increases  O
with  O
lactose    B-Chemical
concentration  O
[  O
24  O
].  O

In  O
the  O
collected  O
samples  O
of  O
yak  O
milk  O
  O
the  O
lactose    B-Chemical
concentrations  O
were  O
higher  O
than  O
that  O
of  O
bovine  O
milk  O
.  O

However  O
  O
the  O
study  O
on  O
yak  O
milk  O
proteins  O
has  O
highlighted  O
the  O
lack  O
of  O
knowledge  O
in  O
the  O
literature  O
  O
deep  O
further  O
study  O
is  O
required  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
level  O
of  O
CN  O
was  O
different  O
between  O
the  O
warm  O
and  O
cold  O
seasons  O
(  O
p  O
<  O
0  O
.  O
5  O
)  O
the  O
ratio  O
of  O
CN  O
/  O
TN  O
was  O
not  O
significantly  O
different  O
.  O

The  O
highest  O
level  O
of  O
CN  O
was  O
found  O
in  O
the  O
warm  O
season  O
  O
which  O
was  O
closely  O
consistent  O
with  O
the  O
changes  O
of  O
TN  O
[  O
23  O
  O
25  O
].  O

For  O
yak  O
milk  O
  O
the  O
variation  O
patterns  O
of  O
CN  O
and  O
CN  O
/  O
TN  O
were  O
consistent  O
with  O
those  O
found  O
in  O
North  O
American  O
commingled  O
goat  O
milk  O
[  O
25  O
].  O

The  O
TN  O
and  O
CN  O
showed  O
significant  O
variability  O
between  O
warm  O
and  O
cold  O
seasons  O
  O
while  O
the  O
ratios  O
of  O
nitrogen    B-Chemical
distribution  O
  O
such  O
as  O
NPN  O

TN  O

WPN  O

TN  O
  O
WPN  O
/  O
CN  O
and  O
CN  O

TN  O
  O
remained  O
constant  O
throughout  O
the  O
seasons  O
.  O

Therefore  O
  O
this  O
pattern  O
of  O
nitrogen    B-Chemical
distribution  O
might  O
be  O
useful  O
in  O
deciding  O
the  O
end  O
use  O
for  O
yak  O
milk  O

The  O

The  O

were  O
much  O
higher  O
than  O
those  O
of  O

The  O

  O
which  O
kept  O

The  O

Human  O
milk  O
  O
as  O

  O
are  O

In  O

seems  O
to  O
vary  O
much  O
more  O

have  O
increased  O
more  O
in  O

Conclusions  O

This  O
work  O
showed  O
that  O
the  O
composition  O
of  O
most  O
of  O
the  O
analyzed  O
yak  O
milk  O
was  O
affected  O
by  O
seasons  O
  O
and  O
differed  O
in  O
some  O
aspects  O
from  O
cow  O
’  O
s  O
milk  O
.  O

The  O
yak  O
milk  O
has  O
higher  O
contents  O
of  O
fat  O
  O
protein  O
  O
lactose    B-Chemical
  O
and  O
total  O
solids  O
than  O
cow  O
milk  O
  O
and  O
its  O
contents  O
changed  O
with  O
the  O
seasons  O
.  O

The  O
yak  O
milk  O
protein  O
contained  O
a  O
higher  O
ratio  O
of  O
WPN  O
/  O
TN  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
noteworthy  O
that  O
calcium    B-Chemical
and  O
iron    B-Chemical
were  O
richer  O
in  O
yak  O
milk  O
than  O
in  O
cow  O
milk  O
.  O

These  O
differences  O
suggested  O
that  O
yak  O
milk  O
can  O
serve  O
as  O
nutritional  O
ingredients  O
with  O
the  O

Introduction  O

The  O
melanoma  O
remains  O
the  O
leading  O
cause  O
of  O
death  O
from  O
skin  O
diseases  O
due  O
to  O
its  O
propensity  O
to  O
metastasis  O
.  O

The  O
statistical  O
analysis  O
from  O
American  O
Cancer  O
Society  O
indicated  O
that  O
in  O
2008  O
  O
there  O
were  O
8  O
  O
420  O
melanoma  O
-  O
associated  O
deaths  O
in  O
the  O
U  O
.  O
S  O
.  O

and  O
the  O
number  O
of  O
new  O
cases  O
of  O
invasive  O
melanoma  O
was  O
estimated  O
at  O
62  O
  O
480  O
.  O

The  O
incidence  O
of  O
melanoma  O
has  O
increased  O
in  O
the  O
past  O
few  O
decades  O
in  O
the  O
United  O
States  O
and  O
is  O
increasing  O
rapidly  O
in  O
children  O
–.  O

If  O
recognized  O
and  O
treated  O
early  O
  O
melanoma  O
is  O
curable  O
  O
but  O
as  O
the  O
disease  O
progresses  O
its  O
propensity  O
to  O
metastasize  O
make  O
it  O
difficult  O
to  O
treat  O
.  O

Chronic  O
exposure  O
to  O
solar  O
ultraviolet  O
(  O
UV  O
)  O
radiation  O
has  O
been  O
implicated  O
in  O
melanoma  O
and  O
non  O
-  O
melanoma  O
skin  O
cancers  O
  O
.  O

Exposure  O
of  O
the  O
skin  O
to  O
UV  O
radiation  O
induces  O
an  O
increase  O
in  O
the  O
expression  O
levels  O
of  O
cyclooxygenase  O
-  O
2  O
(  O
COX  O
-  O
2  O
)  O
a  O
rate  O
-  O
limiting  O
enzyme  O
that  O
catalyzes  O
the  O
conversion  O
of  O
arachidonic    B-Chemical
acid    I-Chemical
to  O
prostaglandins    B-Chemical
(  O
PGs    B-Chemical
).  O

The  O
enhanced  O
generation  O
of  O
PGs    B-Chemical
  O
specifically  O
PGE2    B-Chemical
  O
plays  O
a  O
central  O
role  O
in  O
orchestrating  O
the  O
multiple  O
events  O
involved  O
in  O
cancer  O
invasion  O
and  O
metastasis  O
.  O

PGE2    B-Chemical
is  O
an  O
important  O
metabolite  O
which  O
has  O
been  O
implicated  O
in  O
these  O
risks  O
more  O
than  O
other  O
PG    B-Chemical
metabolites  O
  O
and  O
has  O
been  O
shown  O
to  O
exert  O
its  O
effects  O
through  O
G  O
protein  O
-  O
coupled  O
receptors  O
  O
EP1  O
  O
EP2  O
  O
EP3  O
and  O
EP4  O
  O
and  O
has  O
been  O
implicated  O
in  O
angiogenesis  O
  O
decreased  O
host  O
immunity  O
and  O
enhanced  O
invasion  O
and  O
metastasis  O
  O
.  O

Although  O
  O
melanoma  O
is  O
less  O
common  O
than  O
other  O
skin  O
cancers  O
  O
it  O
causes  O
the  O
majority  O
(  O
75  O
%)  O
of  O
skin  O
cancer  O
-  O
related  O
deaths  O
.  O

Once  O
diagnosed  O
with  O
metastatic  O
melanoma  O
  O
most  O
patients  O
will  O
die  O
of  O
their  O
disease  O
within  O
2  O
years  O
  O
.  O

Since  O
  O
melanoma  O
is  O
a  O
highly  O
malignant  O
cancer  O
with  O
a  O
potent  O
capacity  O
to  O
metastasize  O
distantly  O
  O
an  O
approach  O
that  O
reduces  O
its  O
metastatic  O
ability  O
may  O
facilitate  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
an  O
effective  O
strategy  O
for  O
its  O

For  O
this  O
purpose  O
  O
two  O

were  O
used  O
as  O
an  O

for  O
this  O

.  O

In  O
preliminary  O

  O
we  O
identified  O
that  O
EGCG    B-Chemical
is  O
a  O
major  O

compared  O
to  O
other  O
catechins    B-Chemical

We  O
further  O
characterized  O
the  O

PGE2    B-Chemical
on  O
the  O

were  O
used  O
as  O

Due  O
to  O

  O
both  O

appeared  O
3  O

4  O

higher  O
than  O
the  O

Thus  O
  O

Additionally  O
  O
a  O

This  O
smaller  O
band  O
also  O
appeared  O
higher  O

  O

  O

Background  O

Cortactin  O
is  O
a  O
key  O
regulator  O
of  O
the  O
actin  O
cytoskeleton  O
and  O
is  O
involved  O
in  O
pathogen  O

host  O
cell  O
interactions  O
.  O

Numerous  O
pathogens  O
exploit  O
the  O
phagocytic  O
process  O
and  O
actin  O
cytoskeleton  O
to  O
infect  O
host  O
cells  O
.  O

Coxiella  O
burnetii  O
  O
the  O
etiologic  O
agent  O
of  O
Q  O
fever  O
  O
is  O
internalized  O
by  O
host  O
cells  O
through  O
a  O
molecular  O
mechanism  O
that  O
is  O
poorly  O
understood  O
.  O

Here  O
we  O
analyzed  O
the  O
role  O
of  O
different  O
cortactin  O

in  O
the  O
internalization  O
of  O
C  O

phagocytic  O
cells  O
.  O

C  O
.  O
burnetii  O
internalization  O
into  O
HeLa  O
cells  O
was  O
significantly  O
reduced  O
when  O
the  O
cells  O
expressed  O
GFP  O
-  O
cortactin  O
W525K  O
  O
which  O
carries  O
a  O
mutation  O
in  O
the  O
SH3  O
domain  O
that  O
renders  O
the  O
protein  O
unable  O
to  O
bind  O
targets  O
such  O
as  O
N  O

WASP  O
.  O

However  O
  O
internalization  O
was  O
unaffected  O
when  O
the  O
cells  O
expressed  O
the  O
W22A  O
mutant  O
  O
which  O
has  O
a  O
mutation  O
in  O

.  O

We  O
also  O
determined  O
whether  O
the  O
phosphorylation  O
status  O
of  O
cortactin  O
is  O
important  O
for  O
internalization  O
.  O

Expression  O
of  O
GFP  O

cortactin  O
3F  O
  O
which  O
lacks  O

expression  O
of  O

3D  O
  O
a  O
phosphotyrosine    B-Chemical

not  O
affect  O
it  O
.  O

In  O
contrast  O
  O
expression  O
of  O
GFP  O
-  O
cortactin  O
2A  O
  O
which  O
lacks  O
phosphorylatable  O

  O
inhibited  O

Interestingly  O
  O
inhibitors  O
of  O
Src  O
kinase  O
and  O
the  O
MEK  O

ERK  O
kinase  O
pathway  O
blocked  O

In  O
fact  O
  O
both  O

Despite  O
the  O
decrease  O
in  O
kinase  O

  O
cortactin  O
phosphorylation  O
at  O

Conclusions  O
/  O
Significance  O

Our  O
results  O
suggest  O
that  O
the  O
SH3  O
domain  O
of  O
cortactin  O
is  O
implicated  O
in  O
C  O
.  O
burnetii  O
entry  O
into  O
HeLa  O
cells  O
.  O

Furthermore  O
  O
cortactin  O
phosphorylation  O
at  O
serine    B-Chemical
and  O
dephosphorylation  O
at  O
tyrosine    B-Chemical
favor  O
C  O
.  O
burnetii  O

.  O

We  O
present  O
evidence  O
that  O
ERK  O
and  O
Src  O
kinases  O
play  O
a  O
role  O
early  O
in  O
infection  O
by  O
this  O
pathogen  O

Introduction  O

Phagocytosis  O
is  O
the  O
process  O
that  O
cells  O
have  O
developed  O
for  O
the  O
engulfment  O
of  O
particulate  O
material  O
such  O
as  O
apoptotic  O
cells  O
  O
cell  O
debris  O
and  O
  O
also  O
  O
inert  O
particles  O
.  O

Furthermore  O
  O
phagocytosis  O
represents  O
a  O
crucial  O
event  O
that  O
triggers  O
host  O
defense  O
mechanisms  O
against  O
invading  O
pathogens  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
  O
several  O
pathogens  O
have  O
acquired  O
different  O
strategies  O
to  O
alter  O
these  O
mechanisms  O
to  O
survive  O
and  O
multiply  O
within  O
host  O
cell  O
  O
causing  O
infectious  O
diseases  O
  O
.  O

The  O
phagocytic  O
process  O
is  O
initiated  O
by  O
a  O
recognition  O
step  O
in  O
which  O
ligands  O
on  O
the  O
particle  O
surface  O
bind  O
receptors  O
on  O
the  O
membrane  O
of  O
host  O
cells  O
.  O

The  O
ligand  O
-  O
receptor  O
interaction  O
leads  O
to  O
actin  O
cytoskeleton  O
and  O
membrane  O
rearrangements  O
that  O
permit  O
  O
first  O
  O
particle  O
engulfment  O
and  O
  O
later  O
  O
particle  O
sequestration  O
into  O
a  O
phagosome  O
which  O
precedes  O
phagosome  O
maturation  O
into  O
a  O
phagolysosome  O
  O
.  O

Dynamic  O
remodeling  O
of  O
the  O
actin  O
cytoskeleton  O
is  O
not  O
only  O
intimately  O
involved  O
in  O
phagocytosis  O
but  O
also  O
in  O
other  O
essential  O
cellular  O
processes  O
  O
including  O
cell  O
adhesion  O
and  O
motility  O
  O
vesicle  O
transport  O
  O
  O
apoptosis  O
and  O
endocytosis  O
  O
all  O
of  O
which  O
require  O
dynamic  O
remodeling  O
of  O
the  O
actin  O
cytoskeleton  O
.  O

There  O
are  O
numerous  O
actin  O
-  O
associated  O
proteins  O
and  O
several  O
upstream  O
signaling  O
molecules  O
that  O
work  O
in  O
a  O
coordinated  O
way  O
to  O
control  O
with  O
exquisite  O
precision  O
the  O
spatial  O
and  O
temporal  O
assembly  O
of  O
actin  O
structures  O
  O
which  O
can  O
rapidly  O
change  O
in  O
response  O
to  O
internal  O
and  O
external  O
signals  O
  O
.  O

Proteins  O
of  O
the  O
Arp2  O
/  O
3  O
complex  O
that  O
function  O
as  O
nucleators  O
of  O
branched  O
actin  O
filaments  O
are  O
activated  O
by  O
interaction  O
with  O
members  O
of  O
the  O
Wiskott  O
-  O
Aldrich  O
syndrome  O
protein  O
(  O
WASP  O
)  O
family  O
and  O
cortactin  O
  O
.  O

Initial  O
activation  O
of  O
WASP  O
depends  O
on  O
its  O
interaction  O
with  O
Rho  O
family  O
GTPases  O
.  O

These  O
multicomponent  O
complexes  O
of  O
Arp2  O
/  O
3  O
-  O
WASP  O
-  O
cortactin  O
are  O
involved  O
in  O
cellular  O
processes  O
such  O
as  O
cell  O
motility  O
  O
endocytosis  O
and  O
phagocytosis  O
  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
  O
some  O
pathogens  O
can  O
regulate  O
the  O
host  O
actin  O
cytoskeleton  O
during  O
infection  O
  O
.  O

Cortactin  O
is  O
a  O
key  O
regulator  O
of  O
the  O
actin  O
cytoskeleton  O
  O
and  O
it  O
plays  O
a  O
crucial  O
role  O
in  O
tumor  O
cell  O
invasion  O
  O
ruffles  O
and  O
lamellipodium  O
formation  O
during  O
integrin  O
-  O
mediated  O
cell  O
adhesion  O
  O
and  O
podosome  O
formation  O
.  O

Cortactin  O
is  O
also  O
an  O
important  O
component  O
of  O
the  O
endocytic  O
machinery  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
emerged  O
as  O
a  O
common  O
target  O
of  O
pathogen  O
-  O
host  O
cell  O
interactions  O
.  O

For  O
example  O
  O
cortactin  O
has  O
been  O
implicated  O
in  O
the  O
adhesion  O
of  O
Escherichia  O
coli  O
and  O
in  O
invasion  O
by  O
Shigella  O
  O
Neisseria  O
  O
Chlamydia  O
  O
Staphylococcus  O
and  O
Listeria  O
.  O

The  O
phosphorylation  O
status  O
of  O
cortactin  O
has  O
been  O
proposed  O
to  O
differentially  O
regulate  O
the  O
invasion  O
of  O
many  O
microbial  O
pathogens  O
.  O

Cortactin  O
is  O
also  O
involved  O
in  O
actin  O
-  O
based  O
motility  O
of  O
many  O
pathogens  O
during  O
their  O
intracellular  O
trafficking  O
.  O

Cortactin  O
possesses  O
an  O
N  O
-  O
terminal  O
acidic  O
domain  O
(  O
NTA  O
)  O
and  O
F  O
-  O
actin  O
-  O
binding  O
repeats  O
that  O
activate  O
the  O
Arp2  O
/  O
3  O
complex  O
to  O
initiate  O
actin  O
polymerization  O
.  O

Cortactin  O
also  O
has  O
a  O
proline    B-Chemical
-  O
serine    B-Chemical
-  O
threonine    B-Chemical
-  O
rich  O
region  O
(  O
PST  O
)  O
that  O
contains  O
tyrosine    B-Chemical
residues  O
critical  O
for  O
cortactin  O
function  O
.  O

The  O
C  O
-  O
terminal  O
SH3  O
domain  O
of  O
cortactin  O
binds  O
various  O
proteins  O
  O
such  O
as  O
N  O
-  O
WASP  O
proteins  O
  O
.  O

The  O
Verprolin  O
Cofilin  O
Acidic  O
domain  O
(  O
VCA  O
)  O
of  O
WASP  O
members  O
can  O
also  O
activate  O
the  O
Arp2  O
/  O
3  O
complex  O
.  O

Theoretically  O
N  O
-  O
WASP  O
  O
cortactin  O
and  O
the  O
Arp2  O
/  O
3  O
complex  O
can  O
form  O
ternary  O
complexes  O
.  O

Cortactin  O
is  O
phosphorylated  O
by  O
tyrosine  O
kinases  O
(  O

The  O

These  O

can  O
survive  O
for  O
long  O
periods  O
in  O
the  O

Interestingly  O
  O
we  O

These	O
effects	O

Third	O
	O
these	O

the	O
monomerization	O

	O
this	O

In  O
this  O

Because  O

  O
maybe  O

the  O

Ahmad  O
[  O

used  O
these  O

to  O
separate  O
the  O
genotypes  O
that  O
had  O
Dx5  O

from  O
the  O

which  O
had  O
Dx2  O

.  O

In  O
SDS    B-Chemical

method  O
  O
because  O
of  O
closeness  O
of  O
Dx2  O
and  O
Dx5  O
  O
the  O
recognition  O
is  O
very  O
hard  O
.  O

By  O
PCR  O
method  O
and  O
using  O
these  O
specific  O
primers  O
  O
the  O
recognition  O
of  O
these  O

is  O
so  O
easy  O
.  O

P7P8  O
primers  O
belong  O
to  O

According  O
to  O
De  O

[  O

]  O
these  O
primers  O
amplify  O
a  O
band  O
in  O
2775  O
bp  O
  O
but  O
in  O
this  O
study  O
there  O
were  O
two  O
bands  O
(  O
550  O
and  O
1350  O

)  O
for  O
all  O

Therefore  O
these  O

cannot  O
be  O
used  O
for  O

  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
absence  O

By  O
using  O
P9P10  O
  O

that  O
amplify  O

  O
one  O

in  O
eleven  O

others  O
were  O
the  O

Therefore  O
  O
by  O
using  O
these  O

  O
the  O
Dy10  O

can  O
be  O
recognized  O
.  O

All  O
of  O
the  O

except  O
eleven  O
(  O
which  O

showed  O
this  O

They  O
reported  O
a  O

However  O
  O
this  O

Conclusion  O

All  O
of  O
the  O
studies  O
in  O
this  O
field  O
emphasize  O
on  O
the  O
importance  O
of  O
this  O
kind  O
of  O
marker  O
to  O
recognize  O
the  O
gene  O
which  O
affects  O
dough  O
characteristics  O
.  O

The  O
method  O
needs  O
only  O
a  O
few  O
amount  O
of  O
leaf  O
DNA  O
and  O
to  O
prevent  O
the  O
injury  O
(  O
by  O
separating  O
of  O
a  O
piece  O
of  O
endosperm  O
)  O
to  O
embryo  O
[  O

].  O

By  O
the  O
method  O
(  O
marker  O
-  O
assisted  O
selection  O
)  O
selecting  O
and  O
studying  O
about  O
the  O
plants  O
can  O
be  O
possible  O
in  O
all  O
of  O
the  O
life  O
cycle  O
of  O
plant  O
.  O

By  O
marker  O
-  O
assisted  O
selection  O
  O
the  O
recognition  O
between  O
DNA  O
samples  O
which  O
carried  O
alleles  O
related  O
to  O
baking  O
quality  O
is  O
simple  O
and  O
the  O
results  O
could  O
be  O
achieved  O
in  O
about  O
three  O
hours  O
.  O

The  O
method  O
omits  O
using  O
dangerous  O
material  O
like  O
Acrylamide    B-Chemical
and  O
this  O
method  O
is  O
more  O
reliable  O
.  O

Because  O
of  O
the  O
closeness  O
of  O
x2  O
and  O
x5  O
protein  O
coding  O
molecule  O
weight  O
and  O
movement  O
of  O
HMW  O

some  O
miss  O

occurred  O
.  O

On  O
the  O
other  O
hand  O
  O
some  O
mutants  O
in  O
x5  O
cannot  O
be  O
recognized  O
by  O
SDS    B-Chemical
-  O
PAGE  O
method  O
  O
therefore  O
marker  O
-  O
assisted  O
selection  O
is  O
a  O
reliable  O
way  O
to  O
select  O
genotypes  O
.  O

Another  O
benefit  O
to  O
this  O
method  O
is  O
that  O
by  O
using  O
any  O
part  O
of  O
the  O
plant  O
(  O
leaf  O
  O
root  O
  O
seed  O
  O
and  O
stem  O
)  O
this  O
selection  O
can  O
be  O
done  O
.  O

Using  O
multiplex  O
  O
PCR  O
(  O
amplifying  O
some  O
alleles  O
at  O
the  O
same  O
time  O
)  O
can  O
decrease  O
the  O
payment  O
[  O
17  O
].  O

By  O
marker  O
-  O
assisted  O
selection  O
  O
more  O
then  O
1000  O
plants  O
can  O
be  O
selected  O
and  O
evaluated  O
at  O
the  O
first  O
stage  O
of  O
plant  O
growth  O
by  O
breeders  O
[  O
8  O
].  O

Using  O
of  O
diploid  O
part  O
of  O
a  O
plant  O
in  O
comparison  O
to  O
endosperm  O
(  O
triploid  O
)  O
is  O
easier  O
and  O
faster  O
in  O
commenting  O
of  O
the  O
results  O
in  O
the  O
heterozygous  O
plants  O
[  O
22  O
].  O

Finally  O
  O
the  O
last  O
benefit  O
of  O
this  O
marker  O
is  O
that  O
the  O
marker  O
is  O
not  O
affected  O
by  O
internal  O
or  O

Introduction  O

Gla  O

also  O
known  O
as  O

of  O

plate  O
and  O
cartilage  O
matrix  O
associated  O
protein  O
(  O
UCMA  O
)  O
was  O
identified  O
in  O
sturgeon  O
as  O
a  O
new  O
vitamin  O
-  O
K  O
-  O

protein  O
(  O
VKDP  O
)  O
exhibiting  O
an  O
unprecedented  O
high  O
density  O
of  O
Gla    B-Chemical
residues  O
(  O

and  O
a  O

Highly  O
conserved  O
GRP  O
orthologs  O
presented  O
conserved  O
features  O
specific  O
to  O
all  O
VKDPs  O
  O
in  O
particular  O
a  O
remarkably  O
well  O
conserved  O
Gla    B-Chemical
domain  O
  O
thus  O
suggesting  O
GRP  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
new  O
vertebrate  O
-  O
specific  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxylated  O
protein  O
.  O

While  O
in  O
sturgeon  O
GRP  O
was  O
predominantly  O
found  O
in  O
cartilaginous  O
tissues  O
  O
in  O
mammals  O
it  O
was  O
shown  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
wider  O
tissue  O
distribution  O
and  O
to  O
accumulate  O
both  O
in  O
skeletal  O
and  O
connective  O
tissues  O
including  O
bone  O
  O
cartilage  O
  O
skin  O
  O
and  O
vasculature  O
.  O

GRP  O
was  O
found  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
circulating  O
protein  O
and  O
to  O
be  O
associated  O
with  O
calcifying  O
pathologies  O
affecting  O
skin  O
and  O
arteries  O
  O
where  O
it  O
accumulates  O
at  O
sites  O
of  O
ectopic  O
calcifications  O
and  O
colocalizes  O
with  O
calcium    B-Chemical
mineral  O
deposits  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
function  O
of  O
GRP  O
is  O
still  O
unknown  O
  O
it  O
has  O
been  O
suggested  O
to  O
act  O
as  O
a  O
negative  O
regulator  O
of  O
osteogenic  O
differentiation  O
  O
a  O
modulator  O
of  O
calcium    B-Chemical
availability  O
in  O
the  O
extracellular  O
matrix  O
  O
and  O
as  O
a  O
potential  O
inhibitor  O
of  O
soft  O
tissue  O
calcification  O
in  O
connective  O
tissues  O
.  O

In  O
concordance  O
  O
recent  O
functional  O
studies  O
pointed  O
to  O
an  O
essential  O
role  O
of  O
GRP  O
in  O
zebrafish  O
skeletal  O
development  O
and  O
calcification  O
  O
albeit  O
GRP  O
-  O
deficient  O
mice  O
did  O
not  O
reveal  O
evident  O
phenotypic  O
alterations  O
in  O
skeletal  O
architecture  O
  O
development  O
  O
or  O
calcification  O
.  O

While  O
four  O
alternatively  O
spliced  O
transcripts  O
of  O
the  O
GRP  O
gene  O
(  O
GRP  O
-  O
F1  O
  O
-  O
F2  O
  O
-  O
F3  O
  O
and  O
F4  O
)  O
were  O
described  O
in  O
mouse  O
chondrocytes  O
and  O
zebrafish  O
  O
new  O
alternatively  O
spliced  O
transcripts  O
were  O
recently  O
identified  O
in  O
humans  O
.  O

Besides  O
GRP  O
-  O
F1  O
  O
the  O
new  O
variants  O
GRP  O
-  O
F5  O
and  O
GRP  O
-  O
F6  O
were  O
characterized  O
by  O
the  O
loss  O
of  O
full  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxylation  O
and  O
partial  O
secretion  O
functional  O
motifs  O
  O
due  O
to  O
deletion  O
of  O
exon  O
3  O
in  O
F5  O
and  O
exons  O
2  O
and  O
3  O
in  O
F6  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
precise  O
function  O
of  O
the  O
novel  O
human  O
GRP  O
variants  O
and  O
the  O
importance  O
of  O
their  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxylation  O
need  O
to  O
be  O
further  O
addressed  O
  O
the  O
perception  O
that  O
crucial  O
differences  O
exist  O
between  O
mouse  O
and  O
human  O
GRP  O
highlights  O
the  O
need  O
for  O
additional  O
characterization  O
of  O
GRP  O
expression  O
/  O
accumulation  O
patterns  O
in  O
health  O
and  O

.  O

Considering  O
VKDPs  O
for  O
which  O
the  O
function  O
is  O
known  O
  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxylation  O
was  O
shown  O
to  O
be  O
required  O
for  O
biological  O
activity  O
  O
and  O
under  O

or  O
uncarboxylated  O
species  O
are  O
generally  O
regarded  O
as  O
proteins  O
with  O
low  O
or  O
no  O
functional  O
activity  O
.  O

Several  O
factors  O
  O
such  O
as  O
insufficient  O
dietary  O
intake  O
of  O
vitamin    B-Chemical
K    I-Chemical
  O
mutations  O
in  O
the  O
γ  O

  O
result  O
in  O
decreased  O
γ  O

carboxylation  O
of  O
VKDPs  O
  O
which  O
has  O
been  O
associated  O
with  O
an  O
increased  O
risk  O
for  O
osteoporotic  O
bone  O
loss  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
for  O
arterial  O
and  O
skin  O
calcifications  O
.  O

Microcalcifications  O
are  O
also  O
often  O
associated  O
with  O
different  O
types  O
of  O
cancer  O
and  O
are  O
considered  O
as  O
a  O
hallmark  O
for  O
early  O
detection  O
of  O
breast  O
cancer  O
  O
with  O
recognized  O
prognostic  O
relevance  O
.  O

Accumulating  O
evidence  O
suggests  O
that  O
mineralization  O
occurring  O
in  O
breast  O
cancer  O
is  O
a  O
cell  O
-  O
specific  O
regulated  O
process  O
sharing  O
molecular  O
mechanisms  O
involved  O
in  O
arterial  O
pathological  O
mineralization  O
and  O
physiological  O
mineralization  O
in  O
bone  O
.  O

Several  O
reports  O
have  O
described  O
an  O
association  O
of  O
VKDPs  O
with  O
different  O
types  O
of  O
cancer  O
  O
namely  O
  O
matrix  O
Gla  O
protein  O
(  O
MGP  O
)  O
and  O
uncarboxylated  O
prothrombin  O
(  O
des  O
-  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxy  O
prothrombin  O
  O
DCP  O
).  O

Although  O
a  O
relation  O
between  O
MGP  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxylation  O
status  O
and  O
neoplasias  O
is  O
still  O
unknown  O
  O
for  O
prothrombin  O
it  O
was  O
shown  O
that  O
increased  O
circulating  O
DCP  O
can  O
be  O
used  O
as  O
a  O
diagnostic  O
and  O
prognostic  O
marker  O
for  O
hepatocellular  O
carcinoma  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
remarkable  O
that  O
  O
despite  O
the  O
widely  O
reported  O
vitamin    B-Chemical
K    I-Chemical
anticancer  O
potential  O
[  O
and  O
references  O
therein  O
]  O
its  O
mechanism  O
of  O
action  O
in  O
cancerous  O
processes  O
remains  O
elusive  O
.  O

Therefore  O
  O
the  O
identification  O
of  O
new  O
vitamin    B-Chemical
K    I-Chemical
targets  O
in  O
cancer  O
  O
such  O
as  O
GRP  O
  O
may  O
contribute  O
to  O

the  O
role  O
and  O
functional  O
mechanism  O
of  O
vitamin    B-Chemical

in  O

Discussion  O

γ  O
-  O
carboxylation  O
of  O
VKDPs  O
is  O
widely  O
accepted  O
to  O
be  O
determinant  O
for  O
their  O
proper  O
function  O
  O
highlighting  O
the  O
importance  O
of  O
investigating  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxylation  O
status  O
of  O
GRP  O
in  O
humans  O
.  O

Human  O
GRP  O
carboxylation  O
has  O
been  O
hypothesized  O
on  O
the  O
basis  O
of  O
its  O
high  O
sequence  O
similarity  O
with  O
sturgeon  O
protein  O
  O
previously  O
shown  O
to  O
be  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxylated  O
  O
and  O
the  O
identification  O
of  O
specific  O
domains  O
and  O
motifs  O
conserved  O
in  O
other  O
VKDPs  O
.  O

In  O
this  O
work  O
  O
we  O
first  O
investigated  O
GRP  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxylation  O
status  O
in  O
human  O
healthy  O
tissues  O
and  O
further  O
determined  O
its  O
association  O
with  O
ectopic  O
calcification  O
in  O
cancers  O
.  O

Recently  O
we  O
have  O
found  O
additional  O
GRP  O
alternatively  O
splice  O
transcripts  O
in  O
human  O
tissues  O
(  O
GRP  O
-  O
F5  O
and  O
-  O
F6  O

which  O
were  O
different  O
from  O
those  O
previously  O
described  O
for  O
mouse  O
and  O
zebrafish  O
.  O

However  O
  O
the  O
GRP  O
-  O
F1  O
transcript  O
was  O
clearly  O
shown  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
predominantly  O
expressed  O
variant  O
in  O
the  O
control  O
and  O
cancer  O
tissues  O
analyzed  O
.  O

The  O
newly  O
developed  O
conformation  O
-  O
specific  O
antibodies  O
were  O
designed  O
to  O
detect  O
the  O
complete  O
form  O
of  O
human  O
secreted  O
GRP  O
(  O
i  O
.  O
e  O
.  O
the  O
GRP  O
-  O
F1  O
isoform  O
)  O
containing  O
15  O
Glu    B-Chemical
residues  O
potentially  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxylated  O
.  O

Since  O
both  O
GRP  O
-  O
F5  O
and  O
-  O
F6  O
contain  O
exons  O
4  O
and  O
5  O
it  O
would  O
be  O
possible  O
that  O
in  O
certain  O
conditions  O
both  O
cGRP  O
pAb  O
and  O
ucGRP  O
mAb  O
colocalize  O
different  O
GRP  O
isoforms  O
.  O

However  O
  O
in  O
this  O
study  O
the  O
expression  O
of  O
GRP  O
-  O
F5  O
and  O
-  O
F6  O
was  O
undetectable  O
in  O
the  O
majority  O
of  O
the  O
samples  O
analyzed  O
and  O
their  O
contribution  O
for  O
the  O
GRP  O
accumulation  O
pattern  O
was  O
considered  O
to  O
be  O
negligible  O
.  O

By  O
using  O
the  O
new  O
conformation  O
-  O
specific  O
antibodies  O
we  O
were  O
able  O
to  O
demonstrate  O
the  O
differential  O
accumulation  O
patterns  O
of  O
cGRP  O
and  O
ucGRP  O
species  O
in  O
healthy  O
skin  O
and  O
mammary  O
gland  O
tissues  O
  O
their  O
relation  O
with  O
neoplasias  O
  O
and  O
particular  O
association  O
with  O
microcalcifications  O
in  O
skin  O
and  O
breast  O
cancers  O
.  O

In  O
healthy  O
tissues  O
  O
cGRP  O
and  O
ucGRP  O
were  O
found  O
to  O
be  O
colocalized  O
  O
suggesting  O
an  O
incomplete  O
GRP  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxylation  O
status  O
under  O
normal  O
physiological  O
conditions  O
.  O

This  O
result  O
is  O
consistent  O
with  O
the  O
knowledge  O
that  O
all  O
extra  O
hepatic  O
Gla  O
proteins  O
presently  O
investigated  O
are  O
undercarboxylated  O
in  O
non  O

vitamin    B-Chemical

K    I-Chemical
supplemented  O
healthy  O
individuals  O
.  O

Moreover  O
  O
in  O
tumor  O
cells  O
(  O
both  O
in  O
BCC  O
and  O
IDC  O
)  O
cGRP  O
was  O
clearly  O
lower  O
than  O
in  O
non  O
-  O
affected  O
areas  O
  O
whereas  O
ucGRP  O
preferentially  O
associated  O
with  O
tumor  O
cells  O
  O
high  O
amounts  O
of  O
ucGRP  O
were  O
also  O
found  O
at  O
sites  O
of  O
microcalcifications  O
.  O

Since  O
conformation  O

specific  O
GRP  O
antibodies  O
were  O
produced  O
against  O
synthetic  O
peptides    B-Chemical
covering  O
small  O
regions  O
of  O
GRP  O
and  O
possible  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxylated  O
Glu    B-Chemical
residues  O
are  O
present  O
throughout  O
the  O
entire  O
mature  O
protein  O
  O
the  O
possibility  O
of  O
simultaneous  O
detection  O
of  O
c  O
/  O
ucGRP  O
protein  O
forms  O
cannot  O
be  O
completely  O
discarded  O
yet  O
.  O

Further  O
characterization  O
of  O
monospecificity  O
against  O
native  O
GRP  O
species  O
is  O
currently  O
under  O
investigation  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
  O
these  O
antibodies  O
were  O
found  O
to  O
have  O
high  O
specificity  O
towards  O
the  O
respective  O
synthetic  O
GRP  O
-  O
related  O
peptides    B-Chemical
used  O
as  O
antigens  O
and  O
clearly  O
demonstrate  O
different  O
patterns  O
of  O
cGRP  O
and  O
ucGRP  O
protein  O
accumulation  O
in  O
the  O
human  O
tissues  O
analyzed  O
.  O

We  O
have  O
previously  O
suggested  O
that  O
GRP  O
may  O
be  O
a  O
physiological  O
inhibitor  O
of  O
soft  O
tissue  O
calcification  O
accumulating  O
at  O
sites  O
of  O
mineral  O
deposition  O
  O
and  O
the  O
clear  O
association  O
of  O
GRP  O
with  O
microcalcifications  O
present  O
in  O
BCC  O
and  O
IDC  O
further  O
supports  O
a  O
global  O
association  O
of  O
GRP  O
with  O
ectopic  O
calcifications  O
  O
independent  O
of  O
disease  O
etiology  O
.  O

The  O
presence  O
of  O
high  O
amounts  O
of  O
ucGRP  O
at  O
sites  O
of  O
calcification  O
  O
together  O
with  O
(  O
i  O
)  O
the  O
knowledge  O
that  O
Gla    B-Chemical
residues  O
increase  O
calcium    B-Chemical
binding  O
capacity  O
of  O
VKDPs  O
and  O
(  O
ii  O
)  O
that  O
calcification  O
inhibitors  O
are  O
known  O
to  O
accumulate  O
at  O
sites  O
of  O
mineral  O
deposition  O
  O
suggests  O
a  O
pivotal  O
role  O
for  O
GRP  O
in  O
the  O
regulation  O
of  O
mineralization  O
that  O
can  O
be  O
compromised  O
in  O
situations  O
of  O
low  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxylase  O
activity  O
(  O
e  O
.  O
g  O
.  O
by  O
poor  O
vitamin    B-Chemical

status  O
).  O

In  O
analogy  O
  O
impaired  O
carboxylation  O
of  O
MGP  O
  O
leading  O
to  O
the  O
accumulation  O
of  O
substantial  O
amounts  O
of  O
ucMGP  O
at  O
sites  O
of  O
calcification  O
  O
was  O
previously  O
suggested  O
to  O
be  O
associated  O
with  O
a  O
suboptimal  O
capacity  O
of  O
arterial  O
and  O
skin  O
calcification  O
inhibition  O
.  O

In  O
concordance  O
  O
our  O
results  O
show  O
higher  O
levels  O
of  O
GRP  O
-  O
F1  O
expression  O
in  O
IDC  O
cases  O
where  O
ectopic  O
calcifications  O
were  O
present  O
.  O

Although  O
increasing  O
sample  O
sets  O
  O
not  O
yet  O
available  O
in  O
our  O
laboratory  O
  O
would  O
be  O
required  O
to  O
clearly  O
establish  O
a  O
relation  O
between  O
GRP  O
-  O
F1  O
expression  O
levels  O
and  O
cancer  O
development  O
  O
it  O
is  O
interesting  O
to  O
note  O
that  O
expression  O
pattern  O
of  O
GGCX  O
  O
VKOR  O
  O
and  O
MGP  O
was  O
found  O
highly  O
similar  O
to  O
that  O
of  O
GRP  O
-  O
F1  O
.  O

This  O
suggests  O
that  O
genes  O
required  O
for  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxylation  O
respond  O
in  O
a  O
concerted  O
manner  O
according  O
to  O
demands  O
of  O
substrate  O
and  O
should  O
not  O
be  O
limiting  O
factors  O
for  O
carboxylation  O
of  O
VKDPs  O
  O
such  O
as  O
GRP  O
and  O
MGP  O
.  O

However  O
  O
increased  O
gene  O
expression  O
might  O
not  O
reflect  O
protein  O
functionality  O
  O
and  O
impaired  O
GGCX  O
activity  O
has  O
been  O
associated  O
with  O
insufficient  O
γ  O

carboxylation  O
of  O

in  O
cancers  O
  O
while  O
levels  O
of  O
GGCX  O
mRNA  O
have  O
been  O
shown  O
either  O
increased  O
or  O
heterogeneous  O
among  O
hepatocellular  O
carcinomas  O
.  O

Although  O
prolonged  O
subclinical  O
vitamin    B-Chemical
K    I-Chemical
deficiency  O
has  O
been  O
demonstrated  O
as  O
a  O
risk  O
factor  O
for  O
cancer  O

  O
a  O
relation  O
between  O
vitamin    B-Chemical

status  O
or  O
intake  O
and  O
decreased  O
carboxylation  O
of  O
VKDPs  O
is  O
still  O
controversial  O
.  O

However  O
  O
the  O
increased  O
ucGRP  O
accumulation  O
in  O
BCC  O
and  O
IDC  O
and  O
concomitant  O
decreased  O
of  O
cGRP  O
in  O
relation  O
to  O
healthy  O
tissues  O
could  O
be  O
explained  O
by  O
decreased  O
levels  O
of  O
vitamin    B-Chemical

in  O
tumor  O
areas  O
in  O
contrast  O
to  O
non  O

  O
as  O
previously  O
reported  O
.  O

Although  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
studies  O
have  O
shown  O
that  O
different  O
forms  O
of  O
vitamin    B-Chemical
K    I-Chemical
(  O

on  O

  O
most  O
of  O
these  O
effects  O
have  O
been  O
correlated  O
with  O
increased  O
γ  O

of  O

leading  O
to  O

Moreover  O
  O
although  O

Special  O

should  O
be  O

to  O
the  O

Our  O
protein  O

mineral  O
complex  O
in  O

studies  O
provide  O
insights  O
into  O
a  O
possible  O
mechanism  O
explaining  O
the  O
accumulation  O
of  O
GRP  O
at  O
sites  O
of  O
pathological  O
calcifications  O
  O
since  O
we  O
demonstrated  O
that  O
both  O
cGRP  O
and  O
ucGRP  O
have  O
calcium    B-Chemical
mineral  O
-  O
binding  O
capacity  O
and  O
can  O
directly  O
bind  O
BCP    B-Chemical
crystals  O
.  O

Similarly  O
  O
MGP  O
was  O
shown  O
to  O
directly  O
interact  O
with  O
HA  O
crystals  O
involving  O
both  O
phosphoserine    B-Chemical
and  O

residues  O
  O
also  O
for  O
MGP  O
the  O
direct  O
protein  O

HA  O
interaction  O
was  O
suggested  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
mechanism  O
underlying  O
MGP  O
arterial  O
calcification  O
inhibition  O
.  O

Interactions  O
between  O
proteins  O
and  O
biological  O
calcium    B-Chemical

are  O
believed  O
to  O
play  O
a  O
central  O
role  O
in  O
preventing  O

limiting  O
mineral  O
formation  O
in  O
soft  O

  O
being  O
determinant  O
in  O
several  O
physiological  O
processes  O
and  O
associated  O
with  O
pathological  O
conditions  O
.  O

Additional  O
studies  O
are  O
required  O
to  O
further  O
clarify  O
the  O
role  O
of  O
cGRP  O
and  O
ucGRP  O
species  O
in  O
calcium    B-Chemical

nucleation  O

growth  O
and  O
to  O
determine  O
their  O
precise  O
mechanism  O
of  O
action  O
at  O
the  O
molecular  O
level  O
.  O

Although  O
further  O
efforts  O
will  O
be  O
made  O
to  O
highlight  O
the  O
relevance  O
of  O
GRP  O
in  O
cancer  O
processes  O
  O
we  O
showed  O
that  O
GRP  O
is  O
associated  O
with  O
pathological  O
mineralization  O
in  O
cancer  O
and  O
has  O
the  O
in  O

capacity  O
to  O
directly  O
interact  O
with  O
calcium    B-Chemical
crystals  O
.  O

Our  O
results  O
emphasize  O
that  O
the  O
involvement  O
of  O
this  O
protein  O
should  O
be  O
considered  O
whenever  O
conditions  O
for  O
correct  O
carboxylation  O
of  O

are  O
affected  O
.  O

Furthermore  O
  O
the  O

  O
such  O
as  O
MGP  O
  O

  O

  O
has  O
been  O

as  O
a  O

Conclusions  O

Here  O
we  O
report  O
the  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxylation  O
status  O
of  O
GRP  O
-  O
F1  O
in  O
human  O
healthy  O
tissues  O
and  O
its  O
association  O
with  O
skin  O
and  O
breast  O
cancers  O
.  O

The  O
new  O
conformation  O
-  O
specific  O
GRP  O
antibodies  O
enable  O
us  O
to  O
demonstrate  O
that  O
in  O
healthy  O
tissues  O
  O
cGRP  O
and  O
ucGRP  O
were  O
found  O
to  O
be  O
colocalized  O
  O
suggesting  O
an  O
incomplete  O
GRP  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxylation  O
status  O
under  O
normal  O
physiological  O
conditions  O
  O
while  O
ucGRP  O
was  O
the  O
predominant  O
form  O
associated  O
with  O
tumor  O
cells  O
.  O

Our  O
results  O
strengthen  O
the  O
previously  O
reported  O
association  O
of  O
GRP  O
with  O
ectopic  O
calcifications  O
  O
which  O
are  O
particularly  O
relevant  O
in  O
the  O
diagnosis  O
of  O
breast  O
tumors  O
.  O

Our  O
findings  O
suggest  O
that  O
GRP  O
may  O
represent  O
a  O
new  O
target  O
for  O
the  O
anticancer  O
potential  O
of  O
vitamin    B-Chemical
K    I-Chemical
  O
while  O
the  O
degree  O
of  O
GRP  O
γ  O
-  O
carboxylation  O
might  O
be  O
useful  O
as  O
a  O
potential  O
marker  O
for  O
vitamin    B-Chemical

status  O
and  O

Recent  O

Introduction  O

Recently  O
  O
we  O
have  O
synthesized  O
and  O
described  O
tetraantennary  O
[  O

]  O
and  O
triantennary  O
[  O

]  O
oligoglycines    B-Chemical
capable  O
of  O
spontaneous  O
or  O
surface  O
-  O
promoted  O
formation  O
of  O
flat  O
layers  O
in  O
aqueous  O
medium  O
.  O

These  O
layers  O
are  O
one  O
or  O
two  O
molecules  O
thick  O
.  O

The  O
stability  O
was  O
attributed  O
to  O
the  O
formation  O
of  O
a  O
network  O
of  O
hydrogen    B-Chemical
bonds  O
.  O

This  O
class  O
of  O
supramers  O
has  O
been  O
called  O
tectomers  O
.  O

Tectomers  O
in  O
a  O
layer  O
are  O
packed  O
by  O
polyglycine    B-Chemical

type  O
(  O

)  O
[  O

Their  O
helical  O
polypeptide  O
chain  O
fundamentally  O
differs  O
from  O
the  O
canonical  O
α  O

.  O

The  O
association  O
of  O

only  O
when  O

in  O
a  O

equal  O
or  O
greater  O
to  O
seven  O
.  O

Oligoglycines    B-Chemical
with  O
an  O

less  O
than  O
seven  O
do  O
either  O
not  O
associate  O
at  O
all  O
or  O
require  O
extremely  O
favorable  O
conditions  O
  O
in  O
particular  O
surface  O
promotion  O
.  O

Yet  O
  O
the  O
properties  O
of  O
similar  O
biantennary  O
molecules  O
were  O
not  O
investigated  O
.  O

Here  O
  O
we  O
synthesized  O
biantennary  O
oligoglycines    B-Chemical
and  O
studied  O
them  O
in  O
order  O
to  O
determine  O
the  O
necessary  O
and  O
sufficient  O
conditions  O
for  O
self  O
-  O
association  O
.  O

More  O
specifically  O
  O
we  O
investigated  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
structure  O
elements  O
  O
such  O
as  O
the  O
n  O
value  O
  O
the  O
type  O
of  O
terminal  O
substituents  O
  O
and  O
the  O
type  O
of  O
structural  O
motifs  O
(  O
core  O
)  O
where  O
the  O
antennae  O
are  O
connected  O
to  O
each  O
other  O
.  O

The  O
knowledge  O
of  O
the  O
rules  O
found  O
for  O
the  O
unsubstituted  O
assembly  O
of  O
oligoglycines    B-Chemical
may  O
be  O
suitable  O
for  O
us  O
for  O

which  O
prevented  O
the  O

This  O

  O

be  O
heavily  O

  O
or  O

In  O
acidic  O
solutions  O

are  O
repulsed  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
positive  O
charge  O
  O
which  O
hinders  O
tectomer  O

The  O

not  O
only  O
the  O
ability  O

assemble  O

also  O
the  O

Thus  O
  O
in  O

Introduction  O

The  O
biofilm  O
mode  O
of  O
growth  O
is  O
a  O
basic  O
survival  O
strategy  O
deployed  O
by  O
microorganisms  O
in  O
a  O
wide  O
range  O
of  O
environmental  O
  O
industrial  O
and  O
clinical  O
settings  O
.  O

Biofilms  O
are  O
defined  O
as  O
sessile  O
communities  O
of  O
cells  O
attached  O
to  O
each  O
other  O
and  O
/  O
or  O
to  O
surfaces  O
or  O
interfaces  O
which  O
are  O
embedded  O
in  O
a  O
self  O
-  O
produced  O
matrix  O
of  O
extracellular  O
polymeric    B-Chemical
substances    I-Chemical
(  O
EPS    B-Chemical
)  O
  O
.  O

A  O
function  O
frequently  O
attributed  O
to  O
EPS    B-Chemical
is  O
their  O
general  O
protective  O
effect  O
on  O
sessile  O
microorganisms  O
against  O
adverse  O
conditions  O
including  O
presence  O
of  O
most  O
antimicrobial  O
agents  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
supposed  O
to  O
be  O
due  O
mainly  O
to  O
physiological  O
characteristics  O
of  O
biofilm  O
bacteria  O
  O
but  O
also  O
to  O
a  O
barrier  O
function  O
of  O
EPS    B-Chemical
.  O

According  O
to  O
Körstgens  O
et  O
al  O
.  O

the  O
EPS    B-Chemical
matrix  O
also  O
provides  O
biofilm  O
mechanical  O
stability  O
by  O
filling  O
and  O
forming  O
the  O
space  O
between  O
the  O
bacterial  O
cells  O
  O
keeping  O
them  O
together  O
.  O

Biofilm  O
formation  O
by  O
food  O
-  O
related  O
bacteria  O
and  O
food  O
-  O
related  O
pathogenesis  O
are  O
significant  O
problems  O
in  O
the  O
food  O
industry  O
.  O

The  O
attachment  O
of  O
the  O
bacteria  O
to  O
the  O
food  O
product  O
or  O
the  O
product  O
contact  O
surfaces  O
leads  O
to  O
serious  O
hygienic  O
problems  O
and  O
economic  O
losses  O
due  O
to  O
food  O
spoilage  O
  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
sanitation  O
and  O
removal  O
of  O
biofilms  O
in  O
food  O
industry  O
  O
chemical  O
agents  O
and  O
mechanical  O
forces  O
(  O
sonication  O
  O
flushing  O
  O
etc  O
.)  O

are  O
parameters  O
often  O
involved  O
simultaneously  O
.  O

Mechanical  O
actions  O
only  O
allow  O
the  O
removal  O
of  O
the  O
biofilms  O
from  O
the  O
surfaces  O
and  O
once  O
established  O
  O
biofilms  O
are  O
harder  O
to  O
be  O
removed  O
completely  O
.  O

They  O
also  O
cannot  O
kill  O
biofilms  O
and  O
biofilm  O
cells  O
might  O
later  O
re  O
-  O
attach  O
to  O
other  O
surfaces  O
and  O
form  O
a  O
biofilm  O
  O
.  O

Thus  O
  O
disinfection  O
procedure  O
is  O
indispensible  O
with  O
the  O
intention  O
of  O
killing  O
them  O
.  O

However  O
  O
it  O
is  O
important  O
to  O
note  O
that  O
most  O
of  O
the  O
disinfection  O
processes  O
that  O
are  O
implemented  O
are  O
based  O
upon  O
the  O
results  O
of  O
planktonic  O
tests  O
.  O

Therefore  O
  O
such  O
tests  O
do  O
not  O
mimic  O
the  O
behavior  O
of  O
sessile  O
cells  O
and  O
can  O
be  O
highly  O
ineffective  O
when  O
applied  O
to  O
control  O
biofilms  O
.  O

Biofilms  O
have  O
been  O
reported  O
as  O
possessing  O
susceptibilities  O
towards  O
antimicrobials  O
that  O
are  O
100  O
–  O
1000  O
times  O
less  O
than  O
equivalent  O
populations  O
of  O
planktonic  O
counterparts  O
.  O

If  O
a  O
microbial  O
population  O
faces  O
high  O
concentrations  O
of  O
an  O
antimicrobial  O
product  O
  O
susceptible  O
cells  O
will  O
be  O
inactivated  O
.  O

Although  O
some  O
cells  O
may  O
possess  O
a  O
degree  O
of  O
natural  O
resistance  O
and  O
physiological  O
plasticity  O
or  O
they  O
may  O
acquire  O
it  O
later  O
through  O
mutation  O
or  O
genetic  O
exchange  O
.  O

These  O
processes  O
allow  O
the  O
microorganisms  O
to  O
survive  O
and  O
grow  O
.  O

To  O
address  O
the  O
need  O
for  O
novel  O
and  O
improved  O
measures  O
against  O
biofilms  O
especially  O
pre  O
-  O
established  O
biofilms  O
  O
a  O
clear  O
strategy  O
is  O
to  O
study  O
the  O
biofilm  O
life  O
cycle  O
and  O
identify  O
key  O
trigger  O
points  O
that  O
regulate  O
biofilm  O
development  O
.  O

To  O
control  O
biofilm  O
  O
the  O
last  O
stage  O
of  O
biofilm  O
development  O
presents  O
several  O
advantages  O
  O
where  O
a  O
coordinated  O
dispersal  O
of  O
biofilm  O
cells  O
is  O
possible  O
.  O

In  O
a  O
previous  O
study  O
Davies  O
and  O
Marques  O
showed  O
that  O
a  O
synthesized  O

induces  O

.  O

as  O
well  O
as  O
many  O
other  O
strains  O
of  O
microorganisms  O
.  O

They  O
concluded  O
that  O
CDA    B-Chemical
most  O
likely  O
induce  O
the  O
production  O
of  O
degradative  O
enzymes  O
of  O
EPS    B-Chemical
by  O
these  O
microorganisms  O
.  O

Differential  O

  O

Rahmani  O
et  O

(  O
under  O

)  O
indicated  O
that  O
100  O
nM  O
CDA    B-Chemical
(  O
added  O
exogenously  O
to  O
P  O
.  O

)  O
significantly  O
up  O
regulates  O
the  O

including  O

  O

  O

)  O
and  O

for  O
this  O
EPS    B-Chemical

(  O

).  O

Their  O
results  O
also  O
showed  O
that  O
CDA    B-Chemical
down  O
regulates  O
the  O
expression  O
of  O
genes  O
involved  O
in  O
P  O
.  O
aeruginosa  O
attachment  O
to  O
the  O
surfaces  O
(  O
cupA  O
and  O
cupB  O
)  O
which  O
results  O
in  O
reversion  O
of  O
biofilms  O
to  O
a  O
population  O
of  O
planktonic  O
cells  O
with  O
increased  O
susceptibility  O
to  O
antimicrobial  O
agents  O
compared  O
to  O
their  O
sessile  O
counterparts  O
(  O
Rahmani  O
et  O
al  O
.  O
under  O
preparation  O
).  O

Therefore  O
  O
in  O
this  O
investigation  O
we  O
first  O
examined  O
the  O
action  O
of  O
nano  O
-  O
molar  O
concentrations  O
of  O
CDA    B-Chemical
(  O
as  O
an  O
inducer  O
of  O
biofilm  O
dispersal  O
)  O
on  O
dispersion  O
of  O
pre  O
-  O
established  O
biofilms  O
  O
formed  O
by  O
four  O
main  O
food  O
-  O
borne  O
pathogenic  O
or  O
spoilage  O
microorganisms  O
.  O

Our  O
results  O
interestingly  O
showed  O
that  O
only  O
310  O
nM  O
of  O
the  O
signal  O
was  O
enough  O
to  O
reverse  O
pre  O
-  O
established  O
biofilms  O
  O
formed  O
by  O
distant  O
genera  O
of  O
bacteria  O
  O
to  O
their  O
planktonic  O
mode  O
of  O
growths  O
.  O

Since  O
disinfectants  O
and  O
antibiotics  O
have  O
greater  O
bactericidal  O
efficacy  O
against  O
planktonic  O
bacteria  O
than  O
their  O
sessile  O
counterparts  O
  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
CDA    B-Chemical
with  O
common  O
antimicrobial  O
agents  O
could  O
have  O
improved  O
bactericidal  O
efficacy  O
.  O

Thus  O
  O
we  O
then  O
tried  O
to  O
remove  O
and  O
kill  O
pre  O
-  O
established  O
biofilms  O
by  O
using  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
CDA    B-Chemical
and  O
traditional  O
disinfectants  O
or  O
antibiotics  O
which  O
are  O
broadly  O
used  O
in  O
food  O
processing  O
environments  O
and  O
their  O
related  O
medical  O
issues  O
  O
at  O
concentrations  O
that  O
had  O
no  O
significant  O
effects  O
against  O
biofilms  O
  O
to  O
reach  O
a  O
novel  O
mechanism  O
for  O
enhancing  O
the  O
activity  O
of  O
these  O
treatments  O
through  O
the  O
disruption  O
of  O
biofilms  O
.  O

The  O
results  O
presented  O
here  O
demonstrated  O
that  O
following  O
exposure  O
to  O
low  O
concentrations  O
of  O
CDA    B-Chemical
  O
biofilm  O
cells  O
on  O
the  O
surface  O
were  O
easily  O
detached  O
and  O
then  O
killed  O
by  O
antimicrobial  O
agents  O
where  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
310  O
nM  O
CDA    B-Chemical
with  O
examined  O
disinfectants  O
(  O
Percidine    B-Chemical
and  O
Epimax    B-Chemical
S    I-Chemical
)  O
or  O
antibiotics  O
(  O
ciprofloxacin    B-Chemical
  O
vancomycin    B-Chemical
and  O
ampicillin    B-Chemical
)  O
when  O
added  O
to  O
their  O
solutions  O
  O
resulted  O
in  O
approximate  O
80  O
%  O
reduction  O
in  O
biofilm  O
biomass  O
in  O
all  O

.  O

Numerous  O
strategies  O
to  O
control  O
microbial  O
biofilms  O
have  O
been  O
proposed  O
  O
with  O
different  O
degrees  O
of  O
success  O
.  O

In  O
various  O
industrial  O
settings  O
  O
a  O
range  O
of  O
biocides  O
and  O
toxic  O
metals  O
(  O
e  O
.  O
g  O
.  O
tin    B-Chemical
and  O
copper    B-Chemical
)  O
has  O
been  O
used  O
for  O
antifouling  O
coatings  O
and  O
sanitizing  O
purposes  O
  O
  O
however  O
  O
these  O
substances  O
are  O
not  O
appropriate  O
for  O
use  O
in  O
food  O
industries  O
and  O
clinical  O
settings  O
.  O

In  O
this  O
work  O
  O
we  O
showed  O
that  O
CDA    B-Chemical
-  O
based  O
strategies  O
to  O
induce  O
biofilm  O
dispersal  O
involve  O
only  O
nano  O
-  O
molar  O
concentrations  O
of  O
CDA    B-Chemical
that  O
should  O
be  O
safe  O
to  O
humans  O
and  O
to  O
the  O
environment  O
.  O

Besides  O
  O
previous  O
findings  O
showed  O
that  O
CDA    B-Chemical
has  O
no  O
cytotoxic  O
or  O
stimulatory  O
effect  O
on  O
human  O
cells  O
even  O
at  O
high  O
concentrations  O
(  O
up  O
to  O
250  O
µg  O
.  O
ml  O
−  O
1  O
)  O
.  O

Because  O
CDA    B-Chemical
mediates  O
the  O
transition  O
from  O
a  O
biofilm  O
to  O
a  O
planktonic  O
phenotype  O
via  O
a  O
signalling  O
mechanism  O
(  O
because  O
acts  O
at  O
nano  O
-  O
molar  O
concentrations  O
which  O
are  O
consistent  O
with  O
all  O
known  O
cell  O
-  O
to  O
-  O
cell  O
signalling  O
molecules  O
)  O
rather  O
than  O
toxic  O
effect  O
  O
CDA    B-Chemical
-  O
based  O
biofilm  O
control  O
strategies  O
would  O
not  O
be  O
expected  O
to  O
select  O
for  O
resistant  O
strains  O
as  O
seen  O
with  O
antibiotics  O
.  O

Therefore  O
  O
in  O
this  O
study  O
we  O
examined  O
two  O
different  O
combination  O
of  O
CDA    B-Chemical
  O
CDA    B-Chemical
combined  O
disinfectants  O
and  O
CDA    B-Chemical
combined  O
antibiotics  O
  O
to  O
introduce  O
a  O
promising  O
strategy  O
which  O
is  O
appropriate  O
to  O
control  O
biofilms  O
both  O
in  O
food  O
industry  O
and  O
clinical  O
settings  O
.  O

While  O
some  O
free  O
fatty    B-Chemical
acids    I-Chemical
have  O
antimicrobial  O
properties  O
  O
and  O
play  O
a  O
vital  O
role  O
in  O
maintaining  O
the  O
microbial  O
flora  O
of  O
the  O
skin  O
  O
  O
we  O
demonstrated  O
that  O
CDA    B-Chemical
does  O
not  O
inhibit  O
bacterial  O
growth  O
at  O
nano  O
-  O
molar  O
ranges  O
that  O
induce  O
biofilm  O
dispersal  O
.  O

These  O
results  O
were  O
highly  O
in  O
consistent  O
with  O
the  O
results  O
from  O
Jennings  O
et  O
al  O
.  O

study  O
where  O
they  O
showed  O
that  O
CDA    B-Chemical
inhibited  O
bacterial  O
growth  O
only  O
at  O
high  O
(  O
micro  O
-  O
molar  O
to  O
milli  O
-  O
molar  O
)  O
concentrations  O
.  O

This  O
lack  O
of  O
growth  O
inhibition  O
at  O
lower  O
concentrations  O
was  O
not  O
surprising  O
since  O
bacteria  O
produce  O
this  O
unsaturated    B-Chemical
fatty    I-Chemical
acid    I-Chemical
and  O
use  O
it  O
as  O
a  O
signalling  O
molecule  O
.  O

Conclusions  O

Data  O
from  O
this  O
study  O
suggest  O
that  O
application  O
of  O
CDA    B-Chemical
prior  O
to  O
or  O
in  O
combination  O
with  O
disinfectants  O
or  O
antibiotics  O
may  O
allow  O
for  O
novel  O
and  O
improved  O
strategies  O
to  O
control  O
biofilms  O
in  O
industrial  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
clinical  O
settings  O
  O
with  O
clear  O
benefits  O
such  O
as  O
reduced  O
ecological  O
impact  O
and  O
reduced  O

Introduction  O

Diabetes  O
mellitus  O
(  O
DM  O
)  O
is  O
characterized  O
by  O
hyperglycemia  O
and  O
is  O
associated  O
with  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
metabolic  O
disorders  O
  O
that  O
is  O
  O
abnormalities  O
in  O
carbohydrate    B-Chemical
  O
fat  O
and  O
protein  O
metabolism  O
which  O
further  O
result  O
in  O
chronic  O
complications  O
including  O
microvascular  O
  O
macrovascular  O
  O
and  O
neuropathic  O
disorder  O
[  O

].  O

It  O
is  O
dispersed  O
worldwide  O
with  O
prevalence  O
from  O
171  O

in  O
2000  O
to  O
366  O

The  O
currently  O
available  O
oral  O
hypoglycemic  O
and  O
antihyperglycemic  O
drugs  O
for  O

diabetes  O
have  O
their  O
own  O
limitations  O
  O
adverse  O
effects  O
  O
and  O

failures  O
.  O

Therefore  O
  O
to  O
reduce  O
their  O
cost  O
  O
limitation  O
  O
and  O
adverse  O
effects  O
  O
focus  O
has  O
been  O
shifted  O
towards  O
the  O
medicinal  O
herbs  O
for  O
safe  O
and  O
effective  O
use  O
.  O

Recently  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
medicinal  O

are  O
being  O
investigated  O
for  O
their  O
role  O
in  O

Introduction  O

The  O
vertebral  O
column  O
is  O
the  O
defining  O
character  O
of  O
all  O
vertebrates  O
.  O

It  O
consists  O
of  O
an  O
alternating  O
pattern  O
of  O
vertebral  O
bodies  O
(  O
centra  O
)  O
providing  O
strength  O
and  O
support  O
  O
and  O
intervertebral  O
regions  O
(  O
IVR  O
)  O
providing  O
flexibility  O
and  O
resistance  O
to  O
compression  O
.  O

The  O
vertebral  O
column  O
develops  O
from  O
notochord  O
  O
a  O
flexible  O
rod  O
-  O
like  O
structure  O
derived  O
from  O
the  O
mesoderm  O
.  O

In  O
contrast  O
to  O
the  O
notochord  O
in  O
mammals  O
  O
where  O
only  O
remnants  O
exist  O
in  O
the  O
intervertebral  O
disc  O
in  O
adulthood  O
  O
the  O
notochord  O
in  O
many  O
teleosts  O
  O
including  O
Atlantic  O
salmon  O
(  O
Salmo  O
salar  O
)  O
persists  O
in  O
the  O
entire  O
length  O
of  O
the  O
vertebral  O
column  O
throughout  O
the  O
whole  O
lifespan  O
.  O

During  O
the  O
embryonic  O
and  O
larval  O
stages  O
  O
the  O
notochord  O
is  O
the  O
main  O
axial  O
support  O
playing  O
essential  O
roles  O
in  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
the  O
vertebral  O
column  O
by  O
serving  O
structural  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
signalling  O
roles  O
for  O
patterning  O
  O
also  O
of  O
surrounding  O
tissue  O
.  O

Throughout  O
the  O
early  O
yolk  O
-  O
sac  O
stage  O
  O
the  O
notochord  O
of  O
Atlantic  O
salmon  O
is  O
unsegmented  O
with  O
a  O
uniform  O
notochord  O
sheath  O
of  O
even  O
thickness  O
surrounded  O
by  O
the  O
sclerotome  O
(  O
Grotmol  O
et  O
al  O
.  O

2003  O
  O
2005  O
).  O

After  O
hatch  O
  O
when  O
the  O
salmon  O
larvae  O
start  O
to  O
move  O
  O
a  O
stronger  O
backbone  O
is  O
needed  O
and  O
mineralization  O
of  O
the  O
notochord  O
and  O
sclerotome  O
starts  O
(  O
Nordvik  O
et  O
al  O
.  O

2005  O
).  O

Mineralization  O
begins  O
already  O
at  O
650  O
d  O
°  O
in  O
Atlantic  O
salmon  O
  O
when  O
matrix  O
in  O
the  O
outer  O
half  O
of  O
the  O
ventral  O
notochordal  O
sheath  O
becomes  O
mineralized  O
(  O
the  O
chordacentrum  O
).  O

During  O
the  O
growth  O
period  O
from  O
800  O
to  O
1400  O
d  O
°  O
the  O
main  O
events  O
have  O
occurred  O
  O
resulting  O
in  O
the  O
architecture  O
of  O
the  O
adult  O
salmon  O
vertebral  O
column  O
(  O
Nordvik  O
et  O
al  O
.  O

2005  O
).  O

Many  O
studies  O
have  O
focused  O
on  O
early  O
development  O
of  O
the  O
vertebral  O
column  O
.  O

In  O
different  O
teleost  O
species  O
  O
a  O
pool  O
of  O
mesenchymal  O
stem  O
cells  O
(  O
MSCs  O
)  O
and  O
neural  O
and  O
haemal  O
arch  O
cartilages  O
surround  O
the  O
external  O
elastic  O
membrane  O
of  O
the  O
notochord  O
at  O
300  O
d  O
°  O
are  O
described  O
(  O

The  O
process  O
where  O
these  O
cells  O
differentiate  O
and  O
develop  O
into  O
specific  O
tissue  O
types  O
and  O
body  O
parts  O
is  O
complicated  O
  O
highly  O
controlled  O
and  O
orchestrated  O
by  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
signals  O
  O
including  O
external  O
(  O
e  O
.  O
g  O
.  O

temperature  O
and  O
nutrition  O
)  O
and  O
internal  O
(  O
e  O
.  O
g  O
.  O

hormones  O
and  O
transcription  O
factors  O
).  O

The  O
sequential  O
order  O
of  O
these  O
signals  O
is  O
of  O
great  O
importance  O
for  O
correct  O
and  O
normal  O
development  O
.  O

The  O
proteoglycans  O
(  O
PGs  O
)  O
represent  O
a  O
ubiquitous  O
family  O
consisting  O
of  O
more  O
than  O
30  O
members  O
that  O
are  O
involved  O
in  O
many  O
biological  O
processes  O
  O
ranging  O
from  O
structural  O
and  O
mechanical  O
foundation  O
characteristics  O
to  O
biochemical  O
involvement  O
in  O
mineralization  O
  O
growth  O
  O
differentiation  O
and  O
metabolism  O
.  O

PGs  O
are  O
together  O
with  O
collagen  O
the  O
template  O
for  O
mineralisation  O
  O
and  O
their  O
structure  O
and  O
temporal  O
presence  O
are  O
of  O
great  O
importance  O
for  O
correct  O
and  O
normal  O
development  O
.  O

In  O
mammals  O
  O
proteoglycans  O
(  O
PGs  O
)  O
expressed  O
by  O
notochord  O
-  O
like  O
cells  O
in  O
the  O
intervertebral  O
disc  O
  O
are  O
reported  O
to  O
influence  O
disc  O
integrity  O
and  O
function  O
(  O

and  O
the  O
structure  O
of  O
the  O
glycosaminoglycans    B-Chemical
(  O

)  O
attached  O
are  O
known  O
to  O
play  O
pivotal  O
roles  O
for  O
skeletal  O
development  O
(  O
Aszodi  O
et  O
al  O
.  O

2000  O
).  O

PGs  O
in  O
matrix  O
are  O
divided  O
into  O
two  O
major  O
groups  O
  O
the  O
hyalectans  O
and  O
the  O
small  O
leucine  O
-  O
rich  O
proteoglycans  O
(  O
SLRPs  O
).  O

The  O
former  O
is  O
able  O
to  O
aggregate  O
with  O
hyaluronic    B-Chemical
acid    I-Chemical
and  O
link  O
proteins  O
together  O
  O
forming  O
huge  O
hydrated  O
space  O
filling  O
polymers  O
.  O

The  O
SLRPs  O
  O
on  O
the  O
other  O
hand  O
  O
are  O
smaller  O
extracellular  O
molecules  O
that  O
bind  O
to  O
growth  O
factors  O
  O
collagens  O
and  O
other  O
matrix  O
molecules  O
.  O

The  O
common  O
feature  O
for  O
the  O
PG  O
members  O
is  O
a  O
protein  O
core  O
with  O
one  O
or  O
more  O
covalently  O
attached  O
sulphated  O
carbohydrate    B-Chemical
side  O
chains  O
(  O
glycosaminoglycans    B-Chemical
  O
GAGs    B-Chemical
).  O

The  O
core  O
protein  O
of  O
the  O
PGs  O
ranges  O
in  O
molecular  O
sizes  O
from  O
around  O
10  O
kDa  O
to  O
above  O
500  O
kDa  O
  O
and  O
each  O
protein  O
is  O
encoded  O
by  O
a  O
lonely  O
gene  O
belonging  O
to  O
different  O
gene  O
families  O
(  O
Iozzo  O
1998  O
).  O

The  O
multifunctionality  O
is  O
dependent  O
on  O
tissue  O
  O
cell  O
type  O
and  O
/  O
or  O
metabolic  O
context  O
  O
and  O
where  O
the  O
carbohydrate    B-Chemical
chains  O
of  O
the  O
proteoglycans  O
with  O
different  O
structurally  O
modifications  O
fine  O
tunes  O
the  O
proteoglycans  O
interactions  O
with  O
a  O
variety  O
of  O
ECM  O
components  O
and  O
cellular  O
ligands  O
  O
such  O
as  O
chemokines  O
  O
growth  O
factors  O
  O
adhesion  O
molecules  O
and  O
collagens  O
(  O
Hardingham  O
and  O
Fosang  O

).  O

Structurally  O
  O
the  O
GAGs    B-Chemical
are  O
composed  O
of  O
repeating  O
disaccharide    B-Chemical
units  O
consisting  O
of  O
a  O
hexosamine    B-Chemical
and  O
an  O
uronic    B-Chemical

  O
forming  O

Discussion  O

The  O
present  O
study  O
describes  O
the  O
distribution  O
of  O
sulphated  O
GAGs    B-Chemical
in  O
the  O
vertebral  O
column  O
of  O
Atlantic  O
salmon  O
during  O
development  O
from  O
700  O
to  O
1400  O
d  O

and  O
in  O
15  O
g  O

.  O

During  O
this  O
period  O
  O
the  O
notochord  O
evolves  O
from  O
a  O
fire  O
horse  O

structure  O
to  O
a  O
fully  O
developed  O
  O
segmented  O
and  O
mineralized  O
vertebral  O
column  O
.  O

This  O
includes  O
separation  O
of  O
the  O
vertebrae  O
  O

and  O
insertion  O
of  O

and  O
elaboration  O
of  O
synovial  O
lining  O
to  O
occur  O
simultaneously  O
with  O
continuing  O
growth  O
and  O
mineralization  O
.  O

For  O
all  O
these  O
processes  O
to  O
occur  O
  O
many  O
signals  O
are  O
required  O
and  O
must  O
be  O
highly  O

in  O
distinct  O

for  O
proper  O
differentiation  O
and  O
organization  O
of  O
the  O
tissues  O
involved  O
.  O

Disruption  O
in  O
any  O
of  O
these  O
highly  O
regulated  O
processes  O
may  O
result  O
in  O
pathologic  O
development  O
  O
such  O
as  O
vertebral  O
malformations  O
.  O

Staining  O

was  O
also  O
found  O
in  O

  O

  O
the  O

epitopes  O
showed  O
changing  O
temporal  O
and  O

during  O

.  O

The  O
most  O
striking  O
changes  O
in  O
the  O
composition  O
of  O
the  O
GAGs    B-Chemical
occurred  O
in  O
the  O
IVR  O
  O
suggesting  O
a  O
role  O
for  O
GAGs    B-Chemical
also  O
in  O
the  O
patterning  O
of  O
the  O
vertebral  O
column  O
.  O

At  O
700  O

the  O
IVR  O
was  O
part  O
of  O
a  O
uniform  O

sheath  O
of  O
even  O
thickness  O
  O
consisting  O
primarily  O
of  O
DS    B-Chemical
.  O

The  O
staining  O
pattern  O
for  O
DS    B-Chemical
appeared  O
granulated  O
  O
but  O
was  O
later  O
arranged  O
in  O
IVR  O
as  O
longitudinal  O

.  O

Grotmol  O
(  O

the  O

  O
forming  O
helices  O
around  O
the  O
longitudinal  O
axis  O
of  O
notochord  O
during  O
early  O

.  O

Thus  O
  O
the  O
granular  O

pattern  O
may  O
be  O
due  O
to  O
DS    B-Chemical
chains  O
associated  O
with  O

  O

the  O

.  O

At  O

were  O
arranged  O
also  O
in  O

in  O
the  O

At  O

and  O
in  O
the  O

of  O
vertebral  O

.  O

The  O
expression  O
of  O
these  O
components  O
was  O
confined  O
to  O
distinct  O
regions  O
of  O
the  O
notochord  O
during  O
the  O
period  O
when  O
the  O
vertebral  O
bodies  O
form  O
and  O
mineralize  O
.  O

The  O
results  O
showed  O
a  O
persistent  O
spatial  O
distribution  O
pattern  O
of  O
the  O
GAGs    B-Chemical
from  O
1100  O

to  O
15  O

  O
indicating  O
similar  O

for  O
the  O
different  O
GAGs    B-Chemical
both  O
in  O
the  O
juvenile  O
and  O
in  O
the  O
mature  O
spine  O
.  O

This  O
pattern  O
was  O
disrupted  O
in  O
vertebral  O
malformations  O
  O
exhibiting  O
gross  O
alterations  O
in  O
the  O
composition  O
of  O
the  O
ECM  O
accompanied  O
with  O
an  O
increase  O
in  O
matrix  O

during  O
the  O
pathogenesis  O
.  O

Increased  O
lamellar  O
disorganization  O
and  O
fissures  O
in  O
the  O
IVR  O
were  O
features  O
of  O
vertebral  O
malformation  O
.  O

More  O
GAGs    B-Chemical
was  O
produced  O
in  O
the  O
matrix  O
of  O
notochord  O
during  O
the  O
initial  O

of  O
pathogenesis  O
judged  O
by  O
the  O
stronger  O
staining  O

.  O

We  O
suggest  O
that  O
GAGs    B-Chemical
are  O
important  O
for  O
normal  O
sheath  O
integrity  O
and  O
that  O
altered  O

is  O
of  O
importance  O

Thus  O
  O
the  O
formation  O

the  O
initial  O

The  O

at  O
the  O

these  O

In  O
recent  O
research  O
from  O
this  O

  O
we  O
investigated  O
the  O

(  O

from  O
the  O

and    I-Chemical
OH    I-Chemical
radicals    I-Chemical
  O
based  O
on  O
the  O
kinetic  O
model  O
conclusion  O
that  O
PCDD    B-Chemical

F    I-Chemical
yields  O
are  O
most  O
sensitive  O
to  O
the  O
reactions  O
of  O
CPs    B-Chemical

Thus  O
  O
as  O

our  O

in  O

[  O

From  O
the  O
neurochemical  O
perspective  O
  O
negative  O
and  O
cognitive  O
symptoms  O
are  O
associated  O
with  O
impairment  O
of  O
the  O
glutamatergic  O
system  O
  O
especially  O
in  O
the  O
PFC  O
  O
where  O
ionotropic  O
NMDA  O
receptors  O
are  O
abundant  O
[  O

Glycine    B-Chemical
is  O
a  O
necessary  O

NMDA  O
receptor  O
  O

sarcosine    B-Chemical
(  O

is  O
an  O

acts  O

(  O

[  O

Thus  O
  O
sarcosine    B-Chemical
should  O
improve  O
the  O
inadequate  O
function  O
of  O
NMDA  O
receptors  O
[  O

five  O
times  O

In  O
schizophrenia  O
  O
hypofunction  O
of  O
the  O
NMDA  O
receptor  O
may  O
involve  O
GABAergic  O
interneurons  O
  O
which  O
would  O
result  O
in  O
disturbed  O
glutamatergic  O
transmission  O
[  O
47  O
].  O

Moreover  O
  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
decrease  O
of  O
glutamate  O
receptor  O
density  O
on  O
GABAergic  O
interneurons  O
[  O
48  O
].  O

The  O
summary  O
effect  O
is  O
the  O
inadequate  O
inhibition  O
of  O
glutamatergic  O
neurons  O
  O
observed  O
in  O
electroencephalography  O
as  O
disturbances  O
of  O
coherent  O
neuronal  O
oscillation  O
at  O
a  O

  O

  O

This  O
information  O
noise  O
negatively  O
affects  O
the  O
concentration  O
process  O
and  O
cognitive  O
functions  O
[  O
53  O
  O

  O
55  O
].  O

Furthermore  O
it  O
can  O
promote  O
hallucinations  O
[  O
56  O
]  O
delusions  O
  O
and  O
disturbances  O
of  O
the  O
thinking  O
processes  O
and  O
cognitive  O
functions  O
typical  O
of  O
acute  O
psychosis  O
.  O

One  O
of  O
the  O
causes  O
of  O
these  O
pathological  O
conditions  O
is  O
a  O
dysfunction  O
of  O
default  O
mode  O

(  O
DMN  O
)  O
the  O

In  O

Research  O
conducted  O

resulted  O
in  O
increased  O
glutamatergic  O

in  O

[  O

Most  O

Glx    B-Chemical
only  O
in  O
MPFC  O
but  O
not  O
in  O
DLPFC  O
[  O
60  O
].  O

In  O
the  O
present  O
study  O
  O
a  O
trend  O
was  O
observed  O
towards  O
a  O
decrease  O
of  O
Glx    B-Chemical
/  O
Cr    B-Chemical
ratio  O
in  O
both  O

Although  O
it  O
was  O
more  O
expressed  O
in  O
the  O
sarcosine    B-Chemical
group  O
  O
the  O
differences  O
were  O
not  O
significant  O
.  O

Further  O
studies  O
using  O
discreet  O
analysis  O
with  O
a  O
stronger  O
magnetic  O
field  O
are  O
required  O
to  O
support  O

.  O
mI    B-Chemical
(  O
myo    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
Inositol    I-Chemical
)  O

Myoinositol    B-Chemical
is  O
a  O
precursor  O
in  O
the  O
transmission  O
of  O
phosphatidylinositol    B-Chemical
  O
which  O
is  O
a  O
widely  O
accepted  O
glial  O
marker  O
[  O
69  O
].  O

In  O
neurodegenerative  O
processes  O
  O
increased  O
mI    B-Chemical
concentrations  O
co  O
-  O
occur  O
with  O
reduced  O
NAA    B-Chemical
concentrations  O
.  O

Significant  O
increases  O
of  O
mI    B-Chemical
/  O
Cr    B-Chemical
and  O
mI    B-Chemical
/  O
Cho    B-Chemical
ratios  O
in  O
the  O
sarcosine    B-Chemical
group  O
between  O
two  O
spectroscopies  O
  O
and  O
in  O
comparison  O
with  O
the  O
placebo  O
group  O
  O
might  O
indicate  O
unfavourable  O
changes  O
.  O

However  O
  O
some  O
researchers  O
report  O
greater  O
mI    B-Chemical
concentrations  O
to  O
be  O
associated  O
with  O
treatment  O
[  O
41  O
  O
70  O
].  O

Thus  O
  O
administration  O
of  O
sarcosine    B-Chemical
may  O
secondarily  O
activate  O
glial  O
cells  O
  O
mostly  O
astrocytes  O
  O
because  O
glycine  O
transporters  O
and  O
other  O
glutamatergic  O

are  O
abundant  O
in  O
their  O
cell  O

Limitations  O
of  O
the  O
Study  O

Due  O
to  O
the  O
limited  O
number  O
of  O
patients  O
and  O
application  O
of  O
1  O
.  O
5  O
Tesla  O
magnetic  O
resonance  O
  O
conclusions  O
should  O
be  O
formulated  O
moderately  O
  O
as  O
precise  O
separation  O
of  O
glutamate    B-Chemical
  O
glutamine    B-Chemical
and  O
GABA    B-Chemical
spectra  O
requires  O
a  O
3  O
Tesla  O
magnetic  O
field  O
  O
or  O
higher  O
.  O

Analysis  O
of  O
GABA    B-Chemical
concentration  O
could  O
be  O
of  O
special  O
interest  O
  O
because  O
sarcosine    B-Chemical
indirectly  O
acts  O
on  O
the  O
NMDA  O
receptors  O
located  O
also  O
on  O
GABAergic  O
interneurons  O
.  O

A  O
few  O
studies  O
have  O
found  O
that  O
GABA    B-Chemical
concentrations  O
varied  O
depending  O
on  O
the  O
analyzed  O
region  O
  O
including  O
different  O
parts  O
of  O
the  O
frontal  O
cortex  O
[  O
60  O
  O
72  O
].  O

On  O
the  O
other  O
hand  O
  O
prior  O
research  O
has  O
revealed  O
an  O
absence  O
of  O
abnormalities  O
in  O
glutamate    B-Chemical
or  O
glutamine    B-Chemical
concentrations  O
in  O
the  O
DLPFC  O
of  O
unmedicated  O
patients  O
with  O
schizophrenia  O
.  O

Thus  O
  O
the  O
absence  O
of  O
schizophrenia  O
-  O
related  O
glutamate    B-Chemical
abnormalities  O
in  O
this  O
region  O
may  O
limit  O
the  O
ability  O
to  O
detect  O
a  O
treatment  O
-  O
related  O
change  O
in  O
Glx    B-Chemical
ratios  O
  O
which  O
could  O
be  O
detectable  O
in  O
other  O
regions  O
where  O
baseline  O
abnormalities  O
were  O
found  O
  O
such  O
as  O
the  O
MPFC  O
  O
striatum  O
  O
hippocampus  O
or  O
thalamus  O
.  O

Another  O
important  O
limitation  O
of  O
this  O
work  O
is  O
its  O
application  O
of  O
ratios  O
of  O
metabolites  O
concentrations  O
instead  O
of  O
exact  O
concentrations  O
.  O

Despite  O
changes  O
of  O
Cr    B-Chemical
and  O
Cho    B-Chemical
concentrations  O
  O
depending  O
on  O
duration  O
of  O
schizophrenia  O
  O
it  O
has  O
previously  O
be  O
demonstrated  O
that  O
treatment  O
with  O
either  O
atypical  O
or  O
typical  O
medication  O
does  O
not  O
alter  O
Cr    B-Chemical
or  O
Cho    B-Chemical
levels  O
[  O
73  O
].  O

Thus  O
  O
ratios  O
might  O
have  O
a  O
good  O
intra  O
-  O
subject  O
validity  O
[  O
73  O
].  O

Finally  O
  O
it  O
should  O
be  O
noted  O
that  O
applied  O
statistical  O
methods  O
did  O
not  O
protect  O
against  O
Type  O
I  O
errors  O
associated  O
with  O
multiple  O
testing  O
.  O

However  O
  O
although  O
significant  O
differences  O
in  O
particular  O
metabolites  O
could  O
be  O
obtained  O
by  O
chance  O
  O
the  O
clinical  O
improvement  O
seems  O
to  O
confirm  O
their  O
relevance  O
.  O

Introduction  O

In  O
mammalian  O
cells  O
the  O
concentrations  O
of  O
deoxyribonucleoside    B-Chemical
triphosphates    I-Chemical
(  O
dNTPs    B-Chemical
)  O
are  O
regulated  O
by  O
an  O
interplay  O
of  O
synthesis  O
and  O
degradation  O
.  O

Synthesis  O
of  O
dNTPs    B-Chemical
occurs  O
through  O
two  O
pathways  O
  O
de  O
novo  O
synthesis  O
of  O
dNDPs    B-Chemical
in  O
the  O
cytosol  O
by  O
ribonucleotide  O
reductase  O
(  O
RNR  O
)  O

followed  O
by  O
phosphorylation  O
to  O
dNTPs    B-Chemical
by  O
nucleoside  O
diphosphate  O
kinase  O
and  O
salvage  O
of  O
deoxyribonucleosides    B-Chemical
by  O
two  O
parallel  O
sets  O
of  O
deoxynucleoside  O
and  O
-  O
nucleotide  O
kinases  O
in  O
the  O
cytosol  O
and  O
in  O
mitochondria  O
.  O

The  O
rate  O
-  O
limiting  O
step  O
of  O
the  O
salvage  O
pathway  O
is  O
the  O
phosphorylation  O
of  O
deoxyribonucleosides    B-Chemical
to  O
their  O
monophosphates    B-Chemical
  O
catalyzed  O
by  O
thymidine  O
kinase  O
1  O
(  O
TK1  O
)  O
and  O
deoxycytidine  O
kinase  O
(  O

(  O

)  O
and  O
deoxyguanosine  O

(  O

)  O
inside  O
mitochondria  O
.  O

The  O
substrate  O
specificity  O
of  O
each  O
pair  O
of  O
enzymes  O
permits  O
the  O
phosphorylation  O
of  O
all  O
physiological  O
deoxyribonucleosides    B-Chemical
in  O
both  O
instances  O
.  O

Degradation  O
of  O
deoxyribonucleotides    B-Chemical
is  O
carried  O
out  O
by  O
5  O
′-  O
nucleotidases  O
that  O
dephosphorylate  O
nucleoside    B-Chemical
monophosphates    I-Chemical
to  O
deoxyribonucleosides    B-Chemical
  O
inverting  O
the  O
kinase  O
reactions  O
.  O

Deoxyribonucleoside  O
kinases  O
and  O
5  O
′-  O
nucleotidases  O
generate  O
substrate  O
cycles  O
that  O
regulate  O
the  O
exchange  O
of  O
deoxyribonucleosides    B-Chemical
across  O
the  O
plasma  O
membrane  O
  O
thus  O
modulating  O
the  O
overall  O
dNTP    B-Chemical
pool  O
size  O
.  O

Intracellular  O
deoxyribonucleosides    B-Chemical
are  O
also  O
degraded  O
by  O
phosphorylases  O
and  O
deaminases  O
that  O
actively  O
participate  O
in  O
the  O
regulation  O
of  O
dNTP    B-Chemical
pools  O
  O
as  O
demonstrated  O
by  O
the  O
large  O
pool  O
imbalances  O
and  O
severe  O
pathologies  O
arising  O
from  O
their  O
genetic  O
deficiency  O
.  O

The  O
catabolic  O
enzymes  O
mentioned  O
so  O
far  O
are  O
constitutively  O
expressed  O
but  O
show  O
tissue  O
-  O
specific  O
variations  O
.  O

The  O
dNTP  O
triphosphohydrolase  O
SAMHD1  O
is  O
a  O
new  O
addition  O
to  O
the  O
set  O
of  O
catabolic  O
enzymes  O
and  O
has  O
recently  O
emerged  O
as  O
a  O
main  O
actor  O
in  O
the  O
regulation  O
of  O
dNTP    B-Chemical
metabolism  O
.  O

The  O
enzyme  O
cleaves  O
dNTPs    B-Chemical
to  O
deoxyribonucleosides    B-Chemical
and  O
triphosphate    B-Chemical
  O
reversing  O
in  O
a  O
single  O
step  O
the  O
entire  O
salvage  O
pathway  O
  O
which  O
may  O
interfere  O
with  O
the  O
de  O
novo  O
pathway  O
as  O
dNTPs    B-Chemical
are  O
allosteric  O
effectors  O
of  O
ribonucleotide  O
reductase  O
.  O

The  O
impact  O
of  O
SAMHD1  O
activity  O
on  O
dNTP    B-Chemical
pools  O
is  O
surprisingly  O
strong  O
.  O

  O
especially  O
that  O

This  O
effect  O
is  O
particularly  O
marked  O
in  O

cells  O
where  O
the  O
level  O
of  O
SAMHD1  O
is  O
higher  O
than  O
during  O

.  O

The  O

of  O
synthetic  O
and  O
catabolic  O
reactions  O
provides  O
a  O
fine  O
cyclic  O

SAMHD1  O

Crystallographic  O
studies  O

that  O
SAMHD1  O
is  O
a  O
homotetrameric  O
enzyme  O
allosterically  O
regulated  O
by  O
dNTPs    B-Chemical
  O
similar  O

A  O
SAMHD1  O
tetramer  O
contains  O
four  O
catalytic  O
sites  O
specific  O
for  O
deoxyribonucleoside    B-Chemical

eight  O

The  O
solved  O
structures  O
of  O
SAMHD1  O
complexed  O
with  O
effectors  O

illustrate  O
the  O
structural  O
basis  O
for  O
both  O
allosteric  O
control  O
and  O

specificity  O
.  O

Exonuclease  O
activity  O
has  O
also  O
been  O
reported  O
for  O
SAMHD1  O
  O
but  O
the  O
nature  O
of  O
the  O
preferred  O
substrate  O
is  O
controversial  O
.  O

A  O
recent  O
study  O
showed  O
that  O
the  O
triphosphohydrolase  O
and  O
nuclease  O
activities  O
of  O
SAMHD1  O
are  O
inactivated  O
independently  O
by  O
genetic  O
mutations  O
occurring  O
in  O
vivo  O
in  O
patients  O
affected  O
by  O
Aicardi  O
Goutières  O
syndrome  O

So  O
far  O
  O
nobody  O
has  O
shown  O
how  O
the  O
solved  O
three  O
-  O
dimensional  O
structure  O
of  O
active  O
SAMHD1  O
can  O
accommodate  O
both  O
enzyme  O
activities  O
.  O

Although  O
DNA  O
synthesis  O
requires  O
roughly  O
equimolar  O
amounts  O
of  O
the  O
four  O
dNTPs    B-Chemical
  O
these  O
occur  O
at  O
unequal  O
concentrations  O
in  O
cells  O
.  O

Pyrimidine    B-Chemical
dNTPs    I-Chemical
are  O
generally  O
more  O
abundant  O
than  O
purine    B-Chemical
dNTPs    I-Chemical
  O
with  O
dGTP    B-Chemical
as  O
the  O
smallest  O
pool  O
.  O

The  O
advantages  O
of  O
small  O
dGTP    B-Chemical
pools  O
may  O
be  O
rationalized  O
.  O

High  O
dGTP    B-Chemical
concentrations  O
are  O
toxic  O
because  O
dGTP    B-Chemical
stimulates  O
the  O
reduction  O
of  O
ADP    B-Chemical
by  O
RNR  O
  O
and  O
dATP    B-Chemical
is  O
the  O
main  O
negative  O
effector  O
of  O
the  O
enzyme  O
.  O

Moreover  O
  O
dGTP    B-Chemical
is  O
highly  O
mutagenic  O
  O
is  O
prone  O
to  O
oxidative  O
damage  O
  O
and  O
in  O
the  O
oxidized  O
form  O
can  O
be  O
incorporated  O
into  O
DNA  O
  O
reducing  O

An  O
exception  O
to  O
the  O
advantages  O
of  O
small  O
dGTP    B-Chemical
pools  O
is  O
provided  O
by  O

SAMHD1  O

The  O

through  O

However  O
  O
the  O

that  O
converts  O
deoxyguanosine    B-Chemical

that  O

not  O
suffice  O

Indeed  O
  O

The  O

that  O

only  O
moderately  O

Interestingly  O
  O
the  O

Why  O
are  O

so  O
dependent  O
on  O

inside  O

?  O

Our  O
present  O
data  O
suggest  O
that  O
the  O
answer  O
may  O
be  O
SAMHD1  O
  O
whose  O
concentration  O
increases  O
in  O
non  O
-  O
dividing  O
cells  O
.  O

SAMHD1  O
is  O
a  O
nuclear  O
enzyme  O
  O
but  O
its  O
influence  O
spreads  O
to  O
the  O
overall  O
cellular  O
dNTP    B-Chemical
pool  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
permeability  O
of  O
the  O
nuclear  O
envelope  O
to  O
deoxynucleotides  O
.  O

Indeed  O
  O
the  O
anti  O
-  O
HIV  O
-  O
1  O
effect  O
of  O
SAMHD1  O
was  O
attributed  O
to  O
the  O
restriction  O
of  O
cytosolic  O
dNTP    B-Chemical
pools  O
that  O
fall  O
below  O
the  O
km  O
of  O
the  O
viral  O
reverse  O
transcriptase  O
.  O

By  O
degradation  O
of  O
all  O
dNTPs    B-Chemical
in  O
cells  O
with  O
low  O
RNR  O
activity  O
  O
SAMHD1  O
restricts  O
the  O
source  O
of  O
deoxynucleotides  O
for  O
mtDNA  O
synthesis  O
.  O

We  O
demonstrated  O
earlier  O
that  O
mt  O
dNTPs    B-Chemical
largely  O
derive  O
from  O
the  O
cytosolic  O
pool  O
.  O

Two  O
main  O
dNTP    B-Chemical
transporters  O
are  O
known  O
in  O
mammalian  O
cells  O
  O
SLC25A33  O
and  O
SLC25A36  O
  O
both  O
active  O
with  O
pyrimidine    B-Chemical
(    I-Chemical
d    I-Chemical
)    I-Chemical
NTPs    I-Chemical
  O
the  O
latter  O
also  O
with  O
(    B-Chemical
d    I-Chemical
)    I-Chemical
GTP    I-Chemical
.  O

The  O
deoxynucleosides    B-Chemical
produced  O
by  O
SAMHD1  O
enter  O
mitochondria  O
via  O
nucleoside  O
transporters  O
and  O
can  O
be  O
recycled  O
by  O
TK2  O
and  O
dGK  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
mt  O
matrix  O
the  O
resulting  O
deoxynucleotides  O
are  O
sheltered  O
from  O
SAMHD1  O
and  O
can  O
be  O
used  O
for  O
mtDNA  O
replication  O
or  O
re  O
-  O
exported  O
to  O
the  O
cytosol  O
.  O

Thus  O
intramitochondrial  O
salvage  O
may  O
be  O
seen  O
as  O
a  O
cell  O
-  O
autonomous  O
mechanism  O
(  O
primarily  O
)  O
using  O
deoxynucleosides    B-Chemical
derived  O
from  O
dNTPs    B-Chemical
synthesized  O
de  O
novo  O
in  O
the  O
cytosol  O
and  O
hydrolyzed  O
by  O
SAMHD1  O
in  O
the  O
nucleus  O
.  O

By  O
this  O
means  O
quiescent  O
or  O
differentiated  O
cells  O
would  O
protect  O
themselves  O
from  O
viral  O
infections  O
and  O
at  O
the  O
same  O
time  O
secure  O
balanced  O
amounts  O
of  O
precursors  O
for  O
mtDNA  O
maintenance  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
sake  O
of  O
the  O
present  O
argument  O
we  O
do  O
not  O
consider  O
here  O
the  O
lower  O
amounts  O
of  O
deoxynucleosides    B-Chemical
produced  O
from  O
nucleoside    B-Chemical
monophosphates    I-Chemical
by  O
5  O
′-  O
nucleotidases  O
.  O

Phosphorylation  O
of  O
deoxynucleosides    B-Chemical
derived  O
from  O
the  O
extracellular  O
compartment  O
might  O
be  O
a  O
secondary  O
function  O
of  O
mt  O
deoxynucleoside  O
kinases  O
.  O

SAMHD1  O
is  O
especially  O
effective  O
in  O
restricting  O
the  O
size  O
of  O
the  O
dGTP    B-Chemical
pool  O
.  O

When  O
SAMHD1  O
is  O
inactivated  O
dGTP    B-Chemical
undergoes  O
the  O
highest  O
relative  O
increase  O
compared  O
with  O
the  O
other  O
three  O
dNTPs    B-Chemical
  O
implying  O
that  O
recycling  O
of  O
GdR    B-Chemical
is  O
especially  O
important  O
to  O
provide  O
mitochondria  O
with  O
sufficient  O
dGTP    B-Chemical
.  O

The  O
low  O
concentration  O
of  O
dGTP    B-Chemical
in  O
the  O
cytosol  O
of  O
quiescent  O
fibroblasts  O
may  O
reduce  O
the  O
rate  O
of  O
carrier  O
-  O
mediated  O
import  O
of  O
dGTP    B-Chemical
into  O
mitochondria  O
so  O
that  O
recycling  O
of  O
GdR    B-Chemical
becomes  O
limiting  O
to  O
sustain  O
a  O
“  O
normal  O
”  O
mt  O
pool  O
.  O

With  O
the  O
present  O
experiments  O
we  O
show  O
that  O
SAMHD1  O
contributes  O
to  O
the  O
phenotype  O
of  O
dGK  O
deficiency  O
in  O
fibroblasts  O
.  O

In  O
vivo  O
the  O
main  O
target  O
cells  O
of  O
this  O
genetic  O
condition  O
are  O
hepatocytes  O
and  O
neurons  O
  O
where  O
the  O
relative  O
abundance  O
of  O
enzymes  O
in  O
the  O
network  O
outlined  O
in  O

1  O
possibly  O
differs  O
from  O
that  O
in  O
fibroblasts  O
  O
our  O
experimental  O
model  O
.  O

The  O
expression  O
of  O
cytosolic  O
dCK  O
  O
for  O
instance  O
  O
is  O
particularly  O
low  O
in  O
liver  O
and  O
brain  O
  O
increasing  O
the  O
dependence  O
of  O
the  O
mt  O
dGTP    B-Chemical
pool  O
on  O
intramitochondrial  O
salvage  O
of  O
GdR    B-Chemical
.  O

The  O
tissue  O
specificity  O
of  O
dGK  O
deficiency  O
in  O
vivo  O
may  O
be  O
related  O
  O
at  O
least  O
in  O
part  O
  O
to  O
SAMHD1  O
expression  O
.  O

When  O
the  O
gene  O
coding  O
for  O
the  O
protein  O
now  O
known  O
as  O
SAMHD1  O
was  O
first  O
described  O
  O
it  O
was  O
reported  O
to  O
be  O
highly  O
expressed  O
in  O
liver  O
on  O
the  O
basis  O
of  O
multi  O

organ  O
Northern  O

analysis  O
.  O

However  O
  O
a  O
recent  O
study  O
of  O
the  O
protein  O
expression  O
profile  O
in  O
humans  O
demonstrated  O
that  O
the  O
intensity  O
of  O
the  O
SAMHD1  O
signal  O
in  O
an  O
organ  O
mostly  O
depends  O
on  O
the  O
frequency  O
of  O
cells  O
of  O
hematopoietic  O
origin  O
  O
which  O
express  O
the  O
highest  O
level  O
of  O
SAMHD1  O
  O
whereas  O
liver  O
cells  O
contain  O
little  O
SAMHD1  O
.  O

On  O
the  O
other  O
hand  O
  O
SAMHD1  O
is  O
only  O
one  O
enzyme  O
in  O
the  O
regulatory  O
network  O
  O
and  O
its  O
influence  O
on  O
the  O
final  O
concentration  O
of  O
dGTP    B-Chemical
depends  O
also  O
on  O
the  O
relative  O
activities  O
of  O
other  O
enzymes  O
.  O

The  O
importance  O
of  O
ribonucleotide  O
reductase  O
in  O
this  O
respect  O
is  O
highlighted  O
here  O
by  O
the  O
biochemical  O
phenotype  O
of  O
the  O
P1  O
fibroblasts  O
  O
which  O
had  O
higher  O
RNR  O
expression  O
than  O
the  O
other  O
two  O

(  O

and  O
could  O
better  O
recover  O
their  O
mt  O
pool  O
balance  O
and  O
mtDNA  O
upon  O
SAMHD1  O
knockdown  O
.  O

By  O
silencing  O
SAMHD1  O
during  O
quiescence  O
we  O
managed  O
to  O
abolish  O
or  O
contain  O
the  O
mtDNA  O
depletion  O
caused  O
by  O
dysfunction  O
of  O
dGK  O
.  O

Previous  O
studies  O
have  O
demonstrated  O
the  O
possibility  O
of  O
improving  O
mtDNA  O
copy  O
number  O
in  O
cultured  O
dGK  O
-  O
mutated  O

by  O
supplying  O
high  O

(≥  O

of  O
purine    B-Chemical
deoxynucleosides    I-Chemical
(  O

or  O
their  O
monophosphates  O
in  O

of  O
quiescent  O
fibroblast  O
cultures  O
(  O
Ref  O

and  O
references  O

).  O

The  O
two  O
protocols  O
did  O
not  O
substantially  O
differ  O
  O
as  O
nucleoside    B-Chemical
monophosphates    I-Chemical
are  O
dephosphorylated  O
by  O
ectonucleotidases  O
  O
and  O
only  O
the  O
resulting  O
deoxynucleosides    B-Chemical
are  O
able  O
to  O
enter  O
the  O
cells  O
.  O

In  O
dGK  O
-  O
deficient  O
cells  O
GdR    B-Chemical
(  O
and  O
deoxyadenosine    B-Chemical
)  O
can  O
only  O
be  O
phosphorylated  O
in  O
the  O
cytosol  O
by  O
dCK  O
.  O

However  O
  O
only  O
at  O
high  O
concentrations  O
did  O
GdR    B-Chemical
compete  O
with  O
intracellular  O
CdR    B-Chemical
for  O
phosphorylation  O
by  O
dCK  O
  O
whose  O
Km  O
for  O
CdR    B-Chemical
is  O
at  O
least  O
one  O
order  O
of  O
magnitude  O
lower  O
than  O
that  O
for  O
GdR    B-Chemical
.  O

High  O
concentrations  O
of  O
purine    B-Chemical
deoxynucleosides    I-Chemical
are  O
also  O
needed  O
in  O
these  O
experiments  O
to  O
saturate  O
the  O
catabolic  O
activity  O
of  O
adenosine  O
deaminase  O
and  O
purine  O
nucleoside  O
phosphorylase  O
.  O

As  O
an  O
alternative  O
  O
the  O
two  O
enzymes  O
can  O
be  O
blocked  O
by  O
specific  O
inhibitors  O
.  O

Here  O
we  O
tried  O
to  O
favor  O
recycling  O
of  O
endogenous  O
GdR    B-Chemical
produced  O
by  O
SAMHD1  O
by  O
treating  O
cells  O
with  O
immucillin    B-Chemical
H    I-Chemical
  O
but  O
we  O
did  O
not  O
observe  O
any  O
reproducible  O
change  O
in  O
dGTP    B-Chemical
concentration  O
.  O

Our  O
conclusion  O
is  O
that  O
in  O
cultured  O
skin  O
fibroblasts  O
the  O
enzyme  O
does  O
not  O
have  O
a  O
measurable  O
influence  O
on  O
the  O
regulation  O
of  O
endogenous  O
dGTP    B-Chemical
and  O
that  O
the  O
degradation  O
of  O
exogenous  O
GdR    B-Chemical
observed  O
earlier  O
by  O
us  O
and  O
others  O
is  O
carried  O
out  O
mostly  O
by  O
the  O
PNP  O
present  O
in  O
the  O

With  O
the  O
present  O
experiments  O
we  O
have  O
updated  O
the  O
picture  O
of  O
the  O

of  O

in  O
human  O
fibroblasts  O
revealing  O
a  O
functional  O

that  O
changes  O
our  O

Introduction  O

Protein  O
glycosylation  O
  O
the  O
attachment  O
of  O
carbohydrate    B-Chemical
chains  O
to  O
proteins  O
  O
is  O
a  O
common  O
post  O
-  O
translational  O
modification  O
occurring  O
ubiquitously  O
in  O
eukaryotic  O
cells  O
.  O

Intriguingly  O
  O
mutations  O
in  O
genes  O
encoding  O
protein  O
glycosylation  O
enzymes  O
  O
or  O
enzymes  O
synthesising  O
the  O
building  O
blocks  O
for  O
protein  O
glycosylation  O
  O
have  O
recently  O
been  O
identified  O
to  O
cause  O
neuromuscular  O
transmission  O
defects  O
called  O
congenital  O
myasthenic  O
syndromes  O
(  O
CMS  O
).  O

The  O
first  O
of  O
these  O
genes  O
to  O
be  O
correlated  O
with  O
CMS  O
was  O
GFPT1  O
(  O
glutamine  O
-  O
fructose  O
-  O
6  O
-  O
phosphate  O
transaminase  O
1  O
).  O

Mutations  O
in  O
GFPT1  O
cause  O
a  O
distinct  O
sub  O
-  O
class  O
of  O
CMS  O
referred  O
to  O
as  O
“  O
limb  O
-  O
girdle  O
CMS  O
with  O
tubular  O
aggregates  O
”  O
[  O
1  O
  O
2  O
].  O

Subsequently  O
  O
mutations  O
in  O
three  O
genes  O
encoding  O
enzymes  O
of  O
the  O
protein  O
N    B-Chemical
-  O
glycosylation  O
pathway  O
(  O
DPAGT1  O
  O
ALG2  O
and  O
ALG14  O
)  O
were  O
also  O
found  O
to  O
cause  O
limb  O
-  O
girdle  O
CMS  O
[  O
3  O
  O
4  O
].  O

The  O
GFPT1  O
gene  O
encodes  O
a  O
homodimeric  O
  O
cytoplasmic  O
enzyme  O
that  O
catalyses  O
the  O
first  O
step  O
of  O
the  O
hexosamine    B-Chemical
biosynthetic  O
pathway  O
[  O
1  O
].  O

Thus  O
GFPT1  O
converts  O
fructose    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
6    I-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
phosphate    I-Chemical
and  O
glutamine    B-Chemical
into  O
glucosamine    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
6    I-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
phosphate    I-Chemical
and  O
glutamate    B-Chemical
  O
the  O
end  O
product  O
of  O
this  O
pathway  O
is  O
uridine    B-Chemical
diphospho    I-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
N    I-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
acetylglucosamine    I-Chemical
(  O
UDP    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
GlcNAc    I-Chemical
)  O
which  O
is  O
a  O
basic  O
substrate  O
not  O
only  O
for  O
protein  O
N    B-Chemical
-  O
and  O
O    B-Chemical
-  O
linked  O
glycosylation  O
  O
but  O
also  O
for  O
lipid    B-Chemical
glycosylation  O
  O
proteoglycan  O
synthesis  O
  O
and  O
O    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
GlcNAc    I-Chemical
glycosylation  O
[  O
1  O
].  O

Currently  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
clear  O
which  O
of  O
these  O
pathways  O
is  O
affected  O
most  O
by  O
lower  O
levels  O
of  O
UDP    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
GlcNAc    I-Chemical
caused  O
by  O
GFPT1  O
deficiency  O
.  O

However  O
  O
clinical  O
presentation  O
of  O
CMS  O
patients  O
with  O
mutations  O
in  O
DPAGT1  O
  O
ALG2  O
and  O
ALG14  O
is  O
very  O
similar  O
to  O
GFPT1  O
CMS  O
  O
suggesting  O
that  O
impaired  O
protein  O
N    B-Chemical
-  O
glycosylation  O
might  O
be  O
the  O
molecular  O
defect  O
underlying  O
GFPT1  O
CMS  O
.  O

N    B-Chemical
-  O
glycosylation  O
is  O
crucial  O
for  O
the  O
assembly  O
and  O
function  O
of  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
key  O
molecules  O
at  O
the  O
neuromuscular  O
junction  O
  O
like  O
the  O
acetylcholine  O
receptor  O
  O
the  O
muscle  O
-  O
specific  O
kinase  O
(  O
MuSK  O
)  O
and  O
agrin  O
.  O

However  O
  O
it  O
is  O
currently  O
not  O
clear  O
why  O
muscles  O
  O
or  O
more  O
specifically  O
the  O
neuromuscular  O
junctions  O
  O
are  O
more  O
vulnerable  O
than  O
other  O
tissues  O
to  O
GFPT1  O
deficiency  O
.  O

We  O
set  O
out  O
to  O
determine  O
whether  O
protein  O
N    B-Chemical
-  O
glycosylation  O
is  O
impaired  O
or  O
modified  O
in  O
the  O
muscles  O
of  O
CMS  O
patients  O
with  O
GFPT1  O
mutations  O
.  O

Specifically  O
we  O
employed  O
mass  O
spectrometric  O
glycomic  O
methodologies  O
to  O
rigorously  O
characterise  O
N    B-Chemical
-  O
glycosylation  O
in  O

myoblasts  O
from  O
patients  O
with  O

  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
myotubes  O
obtained  O
by  O
their  O
in  O

differentiation  O
.  O

As  O
controls  O
for  O
these  O
analyses  O
  O
we  O
analysed  O
myoblasts  O
from  O
two  O
healthy  O
controls  O
and  O
four  O
patients  O
with  O

that  O
have  O
not  O

Due  O
to  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
muscle  O
biopsies  O
do  O
not  O
provide  O
sufficient  O
sample  O
for  O
glycomic  O

we  O
first  O
established  O
suitable  O

The  O

that  O

  O
which  O
is  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O

because  O
each  O

thus  O
they  O

However  O
  O

All  O

showed  O
a  O
similar  O
profile  O

  O
albeit  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
two  O

of  O

when  O
comparing  O

with  O
the  O

showing  O
somewhat  O
higher  O
levels  O
of  O
the  O
former  O
than  O
observed  O
in  O
the  O
other  O
samples  O
.  O

These  O
unexpected  O
results  O
did  O
not  O
support  O
our  O
hypothesis  O
that  O
branching  O
might  O
be  O
impaired  O
in  O
GFPT1  O
myoblasts  O
.  O

Indeed  O
they  O
suggested  O
that  O
multiantennary  O
glycans    B-Chemical
were  O
possibly  O
slightly  O
more  O
abundant  O
in  O
GFPT1  O
patients  O
than  O
in  O
controls  O
.  O

However  O
  O
it  O
is  O
important  O
to  O
note  O
that  O
increasing  O
numbers  O
of  O
LacNAc    B-Chemical
units  O
is  O
not  O
necessarily  O
indicative  O
of  O
increased  O
branching  O
because  O
these  O
moieties  O
can  O
be  O
present  O
in  O
extended  O
oligo  O
-  O
LacNAc    B-Chemical
antennae  O
rather  O
than  O
as  O
additional  O
antennae  O
.  O

Indeed  O
the  O
MALDI  O
data  O
in  O
Figure  O
1  O
confirm  O
that  O
myoblasts  O
are  O
capable  O
of  O
extending  O
their  O
antennae  O
because  O
many  O
of  O
the  O
glycans  O
at  O
high  O
mass  O
have  O
more  O
than  O
the  O
four  O
LacNAc    B-Chemical
moieties  O
that  O
are  O
the  O
basis  O
of  O
a  O
tetra  O
-  O
antennary  O
glycan  O
.  O

Fortunately  O
isomeric  O
glycans    B-Chemical
differing  O
in  O
branching  O
and  O
oligo  O
-  O
LacNAc    B-Chemical
extensions  O
can  O
be  O
readily  O
distinguished  O

Nevertheless  O
  O
there  O

Importantly  O
  O
their  O

relative  O
to  O
the  O

are  O
similar  O
in  O

We  O
estimate  O

that  O

comprised  O

is  O
due  O
to  O
the  O

good  O

  O
because  O

Both  O

of  O

human  O
myoblasts  O
and  O
human  O
myotubes  O
differentiating  O
from  O
myoblasts  O
in  O

.  O

The  O
main  O
findings  O
of  O
this  O
work  O
are  O
that  O
the  O
N    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
glycan    I-Chemical
profiles  O
of  O
myoblasts  O
(  O
Figure  O

)  O
and  O
myotubes  O
(  O
Figure  O

)  O
from  O
GFPT1  O
patients  O
and  O
a  O
selection  O
of  O
healthy  O
and  O
disease  O
controls  O
are  O
broadly  O
similar  O
.  O

All  O
have  O
comparable  O
levels  O
of  O
high  O
mannose    B-Chemical
and  O
complex  O

type  O
structures  O
.  O

The  O
latter  O
are  O
core  O
fucosylated  O
and  O
capped  O
with  O
α2  O
-  O
3  O
linked  O
sialic    B-Chemical
acid    I-Chemical
.  O

The  O
relative  O
abundances  O
of  O
the  O
bi  O
-  O
tri  O
-  O
and  O
tetraantennary  O
complex  O
-  O
type  O
glycans    B-Chemical
are  O
broadly  O
similar  O
in  O
all  O
samples  O
except  O
for  O
the  O
DOK7  O
myotubes  O
whose  O
multiantennary  O
glycans    B-Chemical
were  O
found  O
to  O
be  O
somewhat  O
more  O
abundant  O
than  O
the  O
other  O
samples  O
(  O
Figure  O
6  O
).  O

These  O
findings  O
are  O
unexpected  O
as  O
our  O
initial  O
hypothesis  O
was  O
that  O
cells  O
from  O
GFPT1  O
patients  O
would  O
have  O
changes  O
in  O
their  O
N    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
glycan    I-Chemical
structures  O
and  O
particularly  O
a  O
reduction  O
in  O
N    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
glycan    I-Chemical
branching  O
.  O

This  O
was  O
based  O
on  O
data  O
we  O
recently  O
published  O
in  O
which  O
we  O
characterised  O
N    B-Chemical
-  O
glycosylation  O
of  O
leukocytes  O
from  O
patients  O
with  O
mutations  O
in  O
phosphoglucomutase  O

)  O

key  O
enzyme  O
in  O
the  O
biosynthesis  O
of  O
UDP    B-Chemical

GlcNAc    I-Chemical
.  O

A  O
reduction  O
in  O
levels  O
of  O
tri  O
-  O
antennary  O
and  O
tetra  O
-  O
antennary  O
N    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
glycans    I-Chemical
was  O
observed  O
which  O
was  O
rationalized  O
by  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
if  O
a  O
comparison  O
is  O
made  O
of  O
the  O
GlcNAc  O
transferases  O
that  O
are  O
responsible  O
for  O
N    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
glycan    I-Chemical
branching  O
the  O
higher  O
Km  O
values  O
(  O
which  O
in  O
Michaelis  O
-  O
Menten  O
kinetics  O
corresponds  O
to  O
low  O
substrate  O
affinity  O
and  O
thus  O
a  O
low  O
catalytic  O
activity  O
)  O
are  O
associated  O
with  O
GlcNAc  O

and  O
GlcNAc  O
transferase  O
V  O
that  O
initiate  O
the  O
third  O
and  O
fourth  O

.  O

Therefore  O
by  O
requiring  O
higher  O
substrate  O
concentrations  O
they  O
will  O
be  O
most  O
impaired  O
by  O
a  O
reduction  O
in  O

  O
which  O
is  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O

because  O
each  O

they  O

  O

that  O

not  O
however  O
rule  O
out  O
that  O

still  O
plays  O
role  O
in  O
the  O

It  O
could  O
be  O
that  O

The  O

Indeed  O
  O

not  O
possible  O
in  O

It  O
is  O

restricted  O

a  O

that  O
such  O

lost  O
in  O

It  O
could  O
also  O
be  O
that  O
the  O

in  O
the  O

of  O
the  O

is  O
different  O
from  O
that  O
in  O

might  O
have  O
changed  O
during  O

In  O
addition  O
  O
the  O
amount  O

the  O

influence  O

The  O
next  O
challenge  O
will  O
be  O
to  O
perform  O
detailed  O
glycoproteomic  O

CMS  O
due  O

mutations  O
and  O
CMS  O
due  O
to  O

would  O

that  O

We  O
chose  O

not  O
previously  O
been  O
found  O
to  O
exhibit  O
defects  O
in  O
N    B-Chemical

glycosylation  O
.  O

Very  O
recently  O
  O
however  O
  O
a  O
study  O
has  O
found  O
that  O
Pompe  O
disease  O
can  O
lead  O
to  O
a  O
Golgi  O

Using  O
a  O
similar  O

to  O
ours  O
  O

have  O
shown  O
that  O
there  O
is  O

hyposialylation  O
in  O

It  O
should  O
be  O
noted  O
that  O
even  O
their  O
control  O

did  O
not  O
show  O
the  O

high  O

that  O
we  O
observed  O
in  O
this  O

It  O
is  O
intriguing  O
that  O
our  O
muscle  O
cells  O
are  O
not  O
showing  O
comparable  O
glycosylation  O
defects  O
.  O

In  O
future  O
work  O
it  O
will  O
be  O
important  O
to  O
investigate  O
whether  O
glycosylation  O

in  O

are  O

very  O
similar  O
amongst  O

Introduction  O

A  O
large  O
number  O
of  O
different  O
tumors  O
occur  O
associated  O
with  O
anemia  O
  O
which  O
ranges  O
from  O
25  O
–  O
75  O
%  O
in  O
cancer  O
patients  O
who  O
undergo  O
surgery  O
[  O
1  O
].  O

Although  O
differing  O
by  O
tumor  O
location  O
  O
the  O
overall  O
prevalence  O
of  O
anemia  O
in  O
colon  O
cancer  O
was  O
around  O
48  O
%  O
with  O
moderate  O
to  O
severe  O
anemia  O
found  O
in  O
more  O
than  O
20  O
%  O
of  O
cases  O
[  O
2  O
].  O

The  O
etiology  O
of  O
anemia  O
in  O
cancer  O
patients  O
is  O
typically  O
multifactorial  O
  O
mainly  O
caused  O
by  O
systemic  O
inflammation  O
with  O
increased  O
hepcidin  O
levels  O
promoted  O
by  O
the  O
tumor  O
itself  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
by  O
iron    B-Chemical
deficiency  O
due  O
to  O
gastrointestinal  O
blood  O
loss  O
that  O
occurs  O
in  O
association  O
with  O
tumor  O
ulceration  O
and  O
with  O
malnutrition  O
derived  O
from  O
the  O
disease  O
itself  O
[  O
3  O
  O
4  O
].  O

Besides  O
  O
blood  O
losses  O
can  O
be  O
stressed  O
during  O
the  O
surgery  O
.  O

Preoperative  O
anemia  O
is  O
emerging  O
as  O
a  O
common  O
and  O
important  O
health  O
problem  O
[  O
5  O
].  O

This  O
condition  O
is  O
extremely  O
common  O
before  O
surgery  O
associated  O
with  O
colorectal  O
cancer  O
(  O
up  O
to  O
70  O
%  O
of  O
patients  O
)  O
[  O
6  O
  O
7  O
]  O
and  O
has  O
also  O
been  O
demonstrated  O
in  O
association  O
with  O
increased  O
postoperative  O
morbi  O
-  O
mortality  O
and  O
duration  O
of  O
hospitalization  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
with  O
reduced  O
quality  O
of  O
life  O
[  O
5  O
  O
7  O
–  O
10  O
].  O

Anemia  O
might  O
contribute  O
to  O
complications  O
during  O
and  O
post  O
-  O
surgery  O
[  O
6  O
  O
7  O
  O
9  O
].  O

In  O
addition  O
  O
a  O
low  O
preoperative  O
hemoglobin  O
concentration  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
major  O
risk  O
factors  O
for  O
transfusion  O
in  O
surgery  O
with  O
moderate  O
to  O
high  O
blood  O
losses  O
[  O
5  O
  O
6  O
  O
10  O
].  O

Jointly  O
  O
the  O
perioperative  O
transfusions  O
unfavorably  O
affect  O
patient  O
outcomes  O
and  O
highlight  O
the  O
risk  O
of  O
postoperative  O
infections  O
  O
surgical  O
reintervention  O
  O
recurrence  O
-  O
metastasis  O
  O
and  O
subsequent  O
cancer  O
-  O
related  O
mortality  O
in  O
colorectal  O
cancer  O
surgery  O
[  O
6  O
  O
11  O
  O
12  O
].  O

Therefore  O
  O
in  O
the  O
context  O
of  O
elective  O
surgery  O
  O
it  O
is  O
advisable  O
as  O
far  O
as  O
possible  O
to  O
detect  O
and  O
evaluate  O
preoperative  O
anemia  O
early  O
enough  O
to  O
start  O
a  O
suitable  O
treatment  O
.  O

Anemia  O
in  O
this  O
patient  O
population  O
is  O
largely  O
due  O
to  O
absolute  O
or  O
functional  O
iron    B-Chemical
deficiency  O
.  O

As  O
such  O
  O
administering  O
iron    B-Chemical
prior  O
to  O
surgery  O
is  O
considered  O
an  O
appropriate  O
treatment  O
[  O
13  O
  O
14  O
].  O

Most  O
anemic  O
patients  O
are  O
treated  O
with  O
oral  O
iron    B-Chemical
  O
although  O
this  O
therapeutic  O
procedure  O
is  O
slow  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
iron    B-Chemical
absorption  O
rate  O
and  O
  O
in  O
the  O
context  O
of  O
a  O
surgical  O
cancer  O
patient  O
  O
clearly  O
insufficient  O
to  O
restore  O
early  O
enough  O
the  O
hemoglobin  O
levels  O
and  O
for  O
iron    B-Chemical
deposit  O
repositioning  O
[  O
14  O
  O
15  O
].  O

However  O
  O
parenteral  O
administration  O
of  O
iron    B-Chemical
could  O
increase  O
up  O
to  O
five  O
times  O
the  O
erythropoietic  O
response  O
  O
which  O
is  O
also  O
associated  O
with  O
a  O
lower  O
frequency  O
of  O
adverse  O
effects  O
in  O
comparison  O
with  O
blood  O
transfusions  O
[  O
13  O
  O
16  O
  O
17  O
].  O

Previous  O
studies  O
have  O
shown  O
that  O
treatment  O
with  O
intravenous  O
iron    B-Chemical
administered  O
at  O
least  O
1  O
week  O
before  O
surgery  O
increases  O
hemoglobin  O
levels  O
and  O
  O
consequently  O
  O
should  O
reduce  O
the  O
need  O
for  O
transfusion  O
of  O
red  O
blood  O
cell  O
(  O
RBC  O
)  O
units  O
during  O
the  O
perioperative  O
period  O
[  O
18  O
–  O
20  O
].  O

Therefore  O
  O
the  O
implementation  O
of  O
intravenous  O
iron    B-Chemical
administration  O
protocols  O
appears  O
to  O
be  O
an  O
effective  O
and  O
safe  O
strategy  O
for  O
the  O
treatment  O
of  O
preoperative  O
anemia  O
and  O
possibly  O
to  O
reduce  O
transfusion  O
requirements  O
and  O
hospitalization  O
in  O
patients  O
scheduled  O
for  O
elective  O
surgery  O
while  O
meeting  O
cost  O
-  O
effectiveness  O
criteria  O
  O
whenever  O
an  O
early  O
detection  O
and  O
diagnosis  O
of  O
preoperative  O
anemia  O
is  O
achieved  O
with  O
the  O
objective  O
to  O
implement  O
this  O
therapeutic  O
choice  O
[  O
13  O
  O
14  O
  O
21  O
].  O

Many  O
unsustained  O
misconceptions  O
constitute  O
a  O
barrier  O
to  O
this  O
approach  O
[  O
15  O
].  O

With  O
this  O
background  O
in  O
mind  O
and  O
considering  O
the  O
lack  O
of  O
studies  O
with  O
a  O

of  O

Discussion  O

Preoperative  O
anemia  O
in  O
patients  O
with  O
surgical  O
bleeding  O
risk  O
associated  O
with  O
colorectal  O
cancer  O
has  O
proved  O
very  O
prevalent  O
and  O
is  O
an  O
independent  O
risk  O
factor  O
for  O
the  O
requirements  O
of  O
allogeneic  O
RBC  O
transfusion  O
[  O
12  O
].  O

Under  O
this  O
global  O
perspective  O
  O
and  O
considering  O
the  O
lack  O
of  O
controlled  O
studies  O
with  O
a  O
significant  O
number  O
of  O
patients  O
  O
our  O
prospectively  O
defined  O
and  O
treated  O
population  O
demonstrated  O
a  O
significant  O
clinical  O
benefit  O
for  O
the  O
preoperative  O
administration  O
of  O
an  O
IV  O
iron    B-Chemical
supplementation  O
using  O
ferric    B-Chemical
carboxymaltose    I-Chemical
(  O
FCM    B-Chemical
)  O
when  O
compared  O
to  O
a  O
retrospective  O
cohort  O
(  O
with  O
similar  O
baseline  O
characteristics  O
).  O

This  O
overall  O
fourfold  O
reduction  O
of  O
transfusions  O
(  O
and  O
hence  O
associated  O
risk  O
factors  O
)  O
was  O
achieved  O
using  O
FCM    B-Chemical
which  O
was  O
well  O
tolerated  O
in  O
this  O
group  O
of  O
patients  O
and  O
demonstrated  O
a  O
favorable  O
benefit  O
-  O
risk  O
profile  O
.  O

Furthermore  O
  O
the  O
observed  O
needs  O
for  O
transfusion  O
were  O
five  O
times  O
(  O
pre  O
-  O
and  O
intraoperative  O
)  O
and  O
almost  O
three  O
times  O
higher  O
(  O
postoperative  O
)  O
for  O
the  O
group  O
that  O
had  O
not  O
received  O
IV  O
iron    B-Chemical
.  O

Interestingly  O
  O
the  O
patients  O
in  O
this  O
cohort  O
were  O
all  O
receiving  O
oral  O
iron    B-Chemical
supplementation  O
at  O
time  O
of  O
diagnosis  O
.  O

Similar  O
decreases  O
in  O
transfusion  O
requirements  O
for  O
FCM    B-Chemical
-  O
treated  O
patients  O
have  O
been  O
reported  O
in  O
a  O

that  O
compares  O
the  O

of  O
FCM    B-Chemical
with  O
the  O
IV  O
iron    B-Chemical
sucrose    I-Chemical
administration  O
in  O
a  O
small  O
cohort  O
of  O
45  O
patients  O
treated  O
for  O
anemia  O
in  O
colon  O
cancer  O
resection  O
[  O
18  O
].  O

In  O
this  O
study  O
  O
Bisbe  O
and  O
collaborators  O
observed  O
a  O
noticeable  O
reduction  O
in  O
the  O
percentage  O
of  O

that  O
required  O

in  O
the  O
FCM    B-Chemical

(  O

as  O

(  O

Analogously  O
  O
similar  O
trends  O
in  O

were  O
observed  O
with  O

[  O

in  O

However  O
  O

  O
the  O

Our  O

In  O

to  O
the  O
reduction  O
in  O

and  O
the  O

  O
our  O

in  O
the  O

periods  O
when  O
treating  O
this  O
kind  O
of  O
patients  O
.  O

Specifically  O
  O
importance  O
should  O
be  O
given  O
to  O
the  O
observed  O
relation  O
to  O
the  O
mean  O

was  O

Likewise  O
  O
the  O

benefits  O
of  O

Finally  O
  O
it  O

these  O

  O
pretreatment  O
with  O

seems  O
to  O
be  O
a  O

The  O
incremental  O
costs  O
of  O
IV  O

treatment  O
are  O
very  O
likely  O
to  O
be  O
offset  O
by  O
the  O

due  O
to  O
reductions  O
in  O
length  O

The  O

As  O
strengths  O
of  O
our  O
study  O
  O
it  O
should  O
be  O
mentioned  O
the  O
number  O
of  O
patients  O
considered  O
for  O
the  O
analysis  O
in  O
the  O
predefined  O
groups  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
their  O
homogenous  O
baseline  O
and  O
clinical  O
characteristics  O
in  O
both  O
groups  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
also  O
important  O
to  O
highlight  O
that  O
the  O
significant  O
trends  O
observed  O
in  O
the  O
measured  O
outcomes  O
were  O
achieved  O
after  O
similar  O
laboratory  O
values  O
at  O
diagnosis  O
and  O
surgical  O
characteristics  O
in  O
both  O
groups  O
  O
although  O
the  O
FCM    B-Chemical
group  O
showed  O
a  O
slightly  O
reduced  O
hemoglobin  O
at  O
baseline  O
.  O

The  O
present  O
study  O
has  O
several  O
limitations  O
that  O
warrant  O
acknowledgment  O
.  O

Specifically  O
  O
the  O
non  O

randomized  O
design  O
limits  O
the  O
interpretation  O
of  O
the  O
results  O
.  O

However  O
  O
these  O
patients  O
represent  O
“  O
real  O
-  O
life  O
”  O
clinical  O
practice  O
  O
and  O
hence  O
  O
this  O
is  O
also  O
a  O
strength  O
of  O
this  O
research  O
.  O

Future  O
randomized  O

focused  O
on  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
FCM    B-Chemical

in  O
preoperative  O

patients  O
vs  O
.  O

a  O
similar  O

may  O
aid  O
to  O
confirm  O
our  O
findings  O
.  O

In  O
conclusion  O
  O
our  O
data  O
demonstrate  O
that  O
preoperative  O

significantly  O
reduced  O
the  O

  O
decreased  O
both  O
the  O

Based  O
on  O

  O
it  O

Introduction  O

Buffalo  O
(  O
Bubalus  O
bubalis  O
)  O
plays  O
a  O
prominent  O
role  O
in  O
rural  O
livestock  O
production  O
.  O

Problems  O
like  O
late  O
onset  O
of  O
reproductive  O
maturity  O
  O
seasonality  O
of  O
breeding  O
  O
late  O
estrus  O
and  O
long  O
calving  O
interval  O
have  O
been  O
attributed  O
to  O
poor  O
reproductive  O
performance  O
of  O
this  O
species  O
[  O
1  O
].  O

To  O
cope  O
up  O
with  O
these  O
problems  O
  O
use  O
of  O
modern  O
biotechnologies  O
  O
such  O
as  O
in  O
vitro  O
fertilization  O
(  O
IVF  O
)  O
and  O
embryo  O
production  O
are  O
required  O
instead  O
of  O
conventional  O
breeding  O
programs  O
[  O
2  O
].  O

A  O
major  O
factor  O
affecting  O
in  O
vitro  O
mammalian  O
embryo  O
development  O
is  O
increased  O
oxidative  O
stress  O
[  O
3  O
]  O
which  O
is  O
due  O
to  O
high  O
lipid  O
content  O
of  O
buffalo  O
oocytes  O
[  O
4  O
].  O

Higher  O
amount  O
of  O
reactive    B-Chemical
oxygen    I-Chemical
species    I-Chemical
(  O
ROS    B-Chemical
)  O
can  O
alter  O
cellular  O
molecules  O
  O
induce  O
developmental  O
block  O
  O
apoptosis  O
and  O
fragmentation  O
of  O
embryos  O
[  O
5  O
].  O

It  O
has  O
been  O
demonstrated  O
that  O
addition  O
of  O
low  O
molecular  O
thiol    B-Chemical
compound  O
such  O
as  O
β    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
mercaptoethanol    I-Chemical
(  O
β    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
ME    I-Chemical
)  O
and  O
cysteamine    B-Chemical
to  O
the  O
maturation  O
medium  O
causes  O
an  O
increase  O
in  O
intracellular  O
glutathione    B-Chemical
(  O
GSH    B-Chemical
)  O
synthesis  O
[  O
6  O
  O
7  O
]  O
and  O
leads  O
to  O
low  O
oxidative  O
stress  O
in  O
many  O
species  O
[  O
8  O
].  O

β    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
ME    I-Chemical
and  O
GSH    B-Chemical
both  O
improve  O
the  O
cell  O
survival  O
by  O
decreasing  O
apoptotic  O
cell  O
death  O
under  O
“  O
redox  O
”  O
state  O
[  O
9  O
].  O

GSH    B-Chemical
directly  O
influences  O
cell  O
death  O
  O
while  O
β    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
ME    I-Chemical
has  O
an  O
indirect  O
effect  O
by  O
supporting  O
increase  O
in  O
intracellular  O
GSH    B-Chemical
level  O
[  O
5  O
].  O

Buffalo  O
oocytes  O
can  O
synthesize  O
de  O
novo  O
during  O
in  O
vitro  O
maturation  O
(  O
IVM  O
)  O
[  O
7  O
]  O
and  O
β    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
ME    I-Chemical
increases  O
cumulus  O
cells  O
expansion  O
which  O
help  O
in  O
GSH    B-Chemical
synthesis  O
[  O

].  O

So  O
far  O
as  O
buffalo  O
oocytes  O
are  O
concerned  O
  O
meagre  O
studies  O
have  O
been  O
carried  O
to  O
know  O
the  O
effects  O
of  O
β    B-Chemical

ME    I-Chemical
on  O
cumulus  O
expansion  O
of  O
oocyte  O
and  O
intracellular  O
GSH    B-Chemical
content  O
.  O

Therefore  O
  O
the  O
present  O
study  O
was  O
carried  O
out  O
to  O
evaluate  O
the  O
effect  O
of  O

Introduction  O

Apicomplexan  O
parasites  O
  O
such  O
as  O
Toxoplasma  O
gondii  O
and  O
Plasmodium  O
spp  O
.  O
the  O
causative  O
agents  O
of  O
toxoplasmosis  O
and  O
malaria  O
  O
require  O
changes  O
in  O
cytosolic  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
concentrations  O
to  O
egress  O
from  O
host  O
cells  O
and  O
move  O
within  O
the  O
infected  O
organism  O
(  O
1  O
–  O
6  O
).  O

These  O
pathways  O
therefore  O
hold  O
tremendous  O
therapeutic  O
potential  O
  O
not  O
only  O
due  O
to  O
their  O
importance  O
in  O
parasite  O
biology  O
but  O
because  O
of  O
their  O
divergence  O
from  O
similar  O
pathways  O
in  O
host  O
cells  O
.  O

Compounds  O
targeting  O
Ca2    B-Chemical

have  O
been  O
shown  O
to  O
be  O
effective  O
antiparasitics  O
(  O

However  O
  O
few  O
of  O
the  O
molecules  O
involved  O
in  O
regulating  O
Ca2    B-Chemical

have  O
been  O
identified  O
in  O
parasites  O
  O
and  O
their  O
interplay  O
is  O
only  O
evident  O
in  O
live  O
cells  O
.  O

This  O
has  O
created  O
a  O

new  O
methods  O
to  O
study  O
Ca2    B-Chemical

Because  O

is  O
a  O
necessary  O
second  O
messenger  O
during  O
egress  O
(  O

we  O
hypothesized  O
that  O
zaprinast    B-Chemical
might  O
stimulate  O

by  O
increasing  O
cytosolic  O
Ca2    B-Chemical

To  O

this  O
  O
we  O

  O
which  O

  O
we  O

However  O
  O

varied  O
in  O
their  O

that  O

may  O

While  O
examining  O

parasites  O
  O
we  O
noticed  O
that  O
this  O
compound  O
did  O
not  O

and  O
in  O
fact  O
suppressed  O

in  O

(  O

To  O
confirm  O
these  O
effects  O
  O
we  O
treated  O
intracellular  O

quantified  O
the  O

  O
using  O

monitor  O
the  O

This  O

is  O
capable  O
of  O
directly  O
measuring  O

for  O
hundreds  O

Surprisingly  O
  O
despite  O
its  O
effects  O
on  O
extracellular  O

  O
Enh1  O
failed  O
to  O
stimulate  O

in  O

as  O
described  O

(  O

examined  O
the  O

found  O
that  O
it  O

Discussion  O

Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
signaling  O
plays  O
a  O
central  O
role  O
in  O
apicomplexan  O
biology  O
  O
yet  O
few  O
of  O
the  O
components  O
that  O
regulate  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
uptake  O
and  O
release  O
have  O
been  O
identified  O
.  O

In  O
this  O
study  O
  O
we  O
extend  O
our  O
understanding  O
of  O
these  O
processes  O
by  O
demonstrating  O
that  O
PKG  O
activity  O
is  O
needed  O
for  O
the  O
robust  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
response  O
elicited  O
by  O
phosphodiesterase  O
inhibitors  O
.  O

Furthermore  O
  O
we  O
determine  O
the  O
source  O
of  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
to  O
be  O
distinct  O
from  O
other  O
previously  O
described  O
stores  O
.  O

We  O
use  O
this  O
phenomenon  O
as  O
the  O
basis  O
of  O
a  O
phenotypic  O
screen  O
that  O
allowed  O
us  O
to  O
identify  O
several  O
novel  O
inhibitors  O
and  O
enhancers  O
of  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
signaling  O
.  O

Two  O
of  O
the  O
inhibitors  O
could  O
be  O
shown  O
to  O
interfere  O
with  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
signaling  O
by  O
specifically  O
targeting  O
parasite  O
PKG  O
.  O

In  O
contrast  O
  O
the  O
enhancers  O
could  O
be  O
shown  O
to  O
increase  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
independently  O
from  O
zaprinast    B-Chemical
and  O
in  O
fact  O
prevented  O
parasite  O
egress  O
by  O
apparently  O
depleting  O
intracellular  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
stores  O
.  O

This  O
compound  O
displayed  O
antiparasitic  O
properties  O
against  O
both  O
T  O
.  O
gondii  O
and  O
P  O
.  O
falciparum  O
  O
establishing  O
a  O
new  O
mechanism  O
for  O
interfering  O
with  O
apicomplexan  O
parasitism  O
.  O

The  O
signaling  O
events  O
that  O
trigger  O
parasite  O
egress  O
remain  O
poorly  O
defined  O
.  O

Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
ionophores  O
have  O
long  O
been  O
known  O
to  O
stimulate  O
egress  O
in  O
T  O
.  O
gondii  O
(  O
64  O
).  O

However  O
  O
more  O
recently  O
  O
phosphodiesterase  O
inhibitors  O
were  O
shown  O
to  O
have  O
similar  O
effects  O
(  O
20  O
  O
61  O
).  O

Our  O
experiments  O
revealed  O
a  O
strong  O
and  O
rapid  O
release  O
of  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
in  O
response  O
to  O
zaprinast    B-Chemical
treatment  O
through  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
both  O

approach  O
to  O
demonstrate  O
specific  O
inhibition  O
of  O
PKG  O
by  O
Cpd1  O
and  O
Cpd2  O
.  O

Sensitivity  O
to  O
both  O
inhibitors  O
depends  O
on  O
the  O
relatively  O
small  O
gatekeeper  O
of  O
apicomplexan  O
PKGs  O
  O
which  O
we  O
mutated  O
to  O
a  O
methionine    B-Chemical
that  O
preserves  O
kinase  O
activity  O
but  O
renders  O
PKG  O
refractory  O
to  O
inhibition  O
(  O

).  O

The  O
changes  O
in  O
the  O
zaprinast    B-Chemical
response  O
caused  O
by  O
Cpd1  O
can  O
therefore  O
be  O
fully  O
attributed  O
to  O
PKG  O
because  O
no  O
such  O
changes  O
were  O
observed  O
upon  O
treatment  O
of  O
the  O
resistant  O
strain  O
(  O
PKG  O

).  O

However  O
  O
comparing  O
the  O
response  O
to  O
zaprinast    B-Chemical
in  O
parasites  O
pretreated  O
with  O
Cpd1  O
with  O
those  O
pretreated  O
with  O
vehicle  O
shows  O
that  O
the  O
initial  O
sharp  O
Ca2    B-Chemical

peak  O
induced  O
by  O
zaprinast    B-Chemical
is  O
incompletely  O
suppressed  O
by  O

  O
in  O
contrast  O
to  O
its  O
complete  O
inhibition  O
of  O
zaprinast    B-Chemical
-  O
induced  O
egress  O
(  O
20  O
).  O

Suppression  O
of  O
this  O
peak  O
appeared  O
greater  O
when  O
assayed  O
using  O
Fura    B-Chemical

)  O
than  O
when  O
using  O
GCaMP6  O
(  O

).  O

This  O
may  O
result  O
from  O
the  O
semiquantitative  O
nature  O
of  O
GCaMP6  O
and  O
the  O
potentially  O
non  O

linear  O
relationship  O
between  O
fluorescence  O
and  O
Ca2    B-Chemical

.  O

Additionally  O
  O
differences  O
in  O
the  O
subcellular  O
distribution  O
of  O
the  O
two  O
indicators  O
may  O
influence  O
their  O
responses  O
to  O
different  O
sources  O
of  O
Ca2    B-Chemical

Ratiometric  O
measurements  O
with  O
Fura    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
2    I-Chemical
also  O
revealed  O
that  O
inhibition  O
of  O
PKG  O
by  O
Cpd1  O
decreased  O
basal  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
concentrations  O
in  O
extracellular  O
parasites  O
  O
suggesting  O
that  O
PKG  O
might  O
also  O
be  O
necessary  O
to  O
maintain  O
resting  O
levels  O
of  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
in  O
extracellular  O
parasites  O
.  O

These  O
changes  O
in  O
basal  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
concentrations  O
might  O
not  O
be  O
evident  O
with  O
GCaMP6f  O
due  O
to  O
its  O
higher  O
Kd  O
(  O
375  O
nm  O
)  O
(  O
59  O
)  O
compared  O
with  O
that  O
of  O
Fura    B-Chemical

2    I-Chemical
(  O
135  O

(  O

).  O

We  O
characterized  O
the  O
zaprinast    B-Chemical
-  O
mobilized  O
store  O
as  O
neutral  O
because  O
it  O
can  O
be  O
depleted  O
by  O
ionomycin    B-Chemical
.  O

However  O
  O
we  O
found  O
that  O
this  O
store  O
is  O
independent  O
of  O
the  O
thapsigargin    B-Chemical
-  O
mobilizable  O
store  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
surprising  O
  O
given  O
that  O
the  O
ER  O
is  O
the  O
only  O
neutral  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
store  O
that  O
has  O
been  O
characterized  O
in  O
T  O
.  O
gondii  O

SERCA  O
  O
the  O
target  O
of  O
thapsigargin    B-Chemical
  O
localizes  O
to  O
the  O
ER  O
in  O
intracellular  O
parasites  O
but  O
redistributes  O
so  O
as  O
to  O
only  O
partially  O
colocalize  O
with  O
the  O
ER  O
in  O
extracellular  O
parasites  O
(  O
54  O
).  O

Because  O
our  O
experiments  O
were  O
done  O
in  O
extracellular  O
parasites  O
  O
it  O
is  O
possible  O
that  O
zaprinast    B-Chemical
mobilizes  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
from  O
a  O
section  O
of  O
the  O
ER  O
lacking  O
SERCA  O
under  O
these  O
conditions  O
  O
as  O
previously  O
suggested  O
for  O
the  O
ethanol    B-Chemical
-  O
mobilized  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
stores  O
(  O
65  O
).  O

In  O
P  O
.  O
falciparum  O
  O
zaprinast    B-Chemical
has  O
been  O
shown  O
to  O
work  O
through  O
P  O
.  O
falciparum  O
PKG  O
to  O
trigger  O
changes  O
in  O
the  O
levels  O
of  O
various  O
precursors  O
of  O
the  O
second  O
messenger  O
IP3    B-Chemical
.  O

Presumably  O
  O
this  O
increases  O
IP3    B-Chemical
  O
which  O
then  O
interacts  O
with  O
the  O
IP3  O
receptor  O
to  O
stimulate  O
release  O
of  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
from  O
intracellular  O
stores  O
(  O
19  O
).  O

An  O
IP3  O
receptor  O
has  O
not  O
been  O
identified  O
in  O
apicomplexans  O
  O
but  O
treating  O
parasites  O
with  O
ethanol    B-Chemical
raises  O
levels  O
of  O
IP3    B-Chemical
and  O
stimulates  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
release  O
  O
providing  O
evidence  O
for  O
the  O
presence  O
of  O
such  O
a  O
channel  O
(  O
66  O
).  O

Our  O
results  O
therefore  O
indicate  O
that  O
zaprinast    B-Chemical
functions  O
  O
at  O
least  O
in  O
part  O
  O
through  O
T  O

probably  O

Genetically  O
encoded  O
calcium    B-Chemical

provide  O
excellent  O

and  O
circumvent  O
many  O
problems  O
associated  O
with  O

and  O
compartmentalization  O
of  O

probes  O
.  O

Here  O
we  O
demonstrate  O
that  O
such  O
indicators  O
can  O
be  O
used  O
to  O
identify  O
compounds  O
that  O
alter  O
apicomplexan  O
Ca2    B-Chemical

and  O
its  O

  O
such  O
as  O

  O
we  O

our  O

demonstrates  O
the  O

of  O
the  O
approach  O
.  O

Unexpectedly  O
  O
our  O
screen  O
also  O
revealed  O
two  O
compounds  O
that  O
  O
when  O
used  O
in  O
combination  O
with  O
zaprinast    B-Chemical
  O
augmented  O
Ca2    B-Chemical

levels  O
.  O

One  O
such  O
compound  O
  O
Enh1  O
  O
elicited  O
repeated  O
cycles  O
of  O
Ca2    B-Chemical

increase  O
and  O
decrease  O
with  O
overall  O
cytosolic  O

building  O
at  O
a  O
population  O
level  O
.  O

These  O
repeated  O
cycles  O
are  O
reminiscent  O
of  O
what  O
others  O
have  O
seen  O
when  O
Fluo    B-Chemical

loaded  O
parasites  O
were  O
treated  O
with  O
thapsigargin    B-Chemical
(  O
54  O
)  O
perhaps  O
indicating  O
that  O
Enh1  O
also  O
inhibits  O
Ca2    B-Chemical

uptake  O
pathways  O
.  O

In  O
contrast  O
to  O
zaprinast    B-Chemical
and  O
Ca2    B-Chemical

ionophores  O
  O
Enh1  O
failed  O
to  O
stimulate  O
egress  O
despite  O
raising  O
cytosolic  O
Ca2    B-Chemical

levels  O
.  O

In  O
fact  O
  O
Enh1  O
blocked  O
the  O
ability  O
of  O
these  O
agonists  O
to  O
stimulate  O
parasite  O
egress  O
.  O

Furthermore  O
  O
treatment  O
with  O
Enh1  O
blocked  O
tachyzoite  O
invasion  O
and  O
plaque  O
formation  O
at  O
concentrations  O
similar  O
to  O
those  O
required  O
to  O
block  O
egress  O
.  O

These  O
results  O
suggest  O
that  O
Enh1  O
depletes  O
essential  O
intracellular  O
Ca2    B-Chemical
+    I-Chemical
stores  O
  O
which  O
have  O
been  O
previously  O
suggested  O
to  O
mediate  O
invasion  O
and  O
egress  O
.  O

Consistent  O
with  O
this  O
view  O
  O
we  O
observed  O
diminished  O
changes  O
in  O

However  O
  O
without  O
a  O
complete  O
understanding  O
of  O
Enh1  O
function  O
  O
we  O
cannot  O
rule  O
out  O
the  O
possibility  O
that  O
inhibition  O
of  O
egress  O
may  O
be  O
independent  O
of  O
its  O
ability  O
to  O
modulate  O
Ca2    B-Chemical

because  O
(  O

a  O

  O

The  O

to  O
be  O

Poor  O
colonisation  O
by  O
the  O
ΔgltB  O
mutant  O

The  O
capacity  O
for  O
colonisation  O
is  O
a  O
key  O
factor  O
in  O
the  O
prevention  O
and  O
treatment  O
of  O
fungal  O
diseases  O
because  O
colonisation  O
on  O
host  O
plants  O
is  O
closely  O
related  O
to  O
biofilm  O
formation  O
in  O
that  O
strong  O
colonisation  O
often  O
leads  O
to  O
good  O
biofilm  O
formation  O
.  O

Previous  O

have  O
suggested  O
that  O
mucoid  O

of  O
the  O
biocontrol  O
strain  O
Pseudomonas  O
fluorescens  O

  O
which  O
have  O
enhanced  O

  O
also  O
display  O
significantly  O
enhanced  O
colonisation  O
in  O
carrot  O
roots  O
[  O

].  O

Using  O
a  O
GFP  O
-  O
labelling  O
technique  O
in  O
this  O
study  O
  O
we  O
assessed  O
the  O
colonisation  O
abilities  O
of  O
the  O
ΔgltB  O
mutant  O
and  O
the  O
WT  O
B  O
.  O

on  O
a  O
rice  O
stem  O
that  O
had  O
been  O
inoculated  O
with  O
R  O
.  O
solani  O
(  O
Fig  O

).  O

After  O
six  O
days  O
  O
the  O
ΔgltB  O
mutant  O
demonstrated  O
poor  O
colonisation  O
  O
not  O
only  O
because  O
there  O
were  O
fewer  O
bacterial  O
cells  O
but  O
also  O
because  O
the  O
mutant  O
cells  O
lacked  O
significant  O
nutrient  O
chemotaxis  O
.  O

This  O
was  O
especially  O
clear  O
by  O
day  O
nine  O
  O
when  O
the  O
WT  O
B  O
.  O
subtilis  O
Bs916  O
cells  O
displayed  O
strong  O
green  O
fluorescence  O
and  O
an  O
obvious  O
clustering  O
effect  O
  O
whereas  O
only  O
small  O
scattering  O
of  O
green  O
fluorescence  O
was  O
observed  O
in  O
the  O
mutant  O
cells  O
via  O
confocal  O
microscopy  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
overall  O
number  O
of  O
bacteria  O
began  O
to  O
decline  O
  O
this  O
clustering  O
effect  O
was  O
still  O
clearly  O
observed  O
in  O
the  O
WT  O
B  O
.  O
subtilis  O
Bs916  O
through  O
day  O
twelve  O
.  O

Similar  O
to  O
day  O
nine  O
  O
only  O
a  O
small  O
scattering  O
of  O
green  O
fluorescence  O
was  O
observed  O
in  O
the  O
ΔgltB  O
mutant  O
.  O

By  O
day  O
fifteen  O
  O
only  O
a  O
few  O
bacterial  O
cells  O
were  O
left  O
in  O
both  O
the  O
WT  O
B  O
.  O
subtilis  O
Bs916  O
and  O
the  O
ΔgltB  O
mutant  O
.  O

The  O
results  O
suggest  O
that  O
the  O
gltB  O
gene  O
is  O
essential  O
for  O
the  O
regulation  O
of  O
bacterial  O
colonisation  O

Here  O
  O
we  O

The  O
ΔgltB  O
mutant  O
showed  O
serious  O
flaws  O
in  O
its  O
ability  O
to  O
form  O
biofilms  O
  O
the  O
resulting  O
biofilms  O
were  O
weak  O

with  O
an  O

and  O
a  O
two  O

that  O
differed  O
greatly  O
from  O
the  O
three  O
-  O
dimensional  O
structure  O
of  O
the  O
biofilms  O
of  O
the  O
WT  O
.  O

To  O
elucidate  O
the  O
regulatory  O
mechanisms  O
of  O
gltB  O
in  O
biofilm  O
formation  O
  O
transcriptome  O
analysis  O
was  O
used  O
to  O
identify  O
differentially  O
expressed  O
genes  O
between  O
WT  O
B  O
.  O
subtilis  O
916  O
and  O
the  O
ΔgltB  O
mutant  O
.  O

The  O
expression  O
of  O
capB  O
(  O
ywsC  O
)  O
was  O
only  O
one  O
-  O
fifth  O
of  O
the  O
level  O
of  O
that  O
in  O
WT  O
B  O
.  O
subtilis  O
916  O
  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
considered  O
to  O
control  O
the  O
biosynthesis  O
of  O
γ    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
PGA    I-Chemical
.  O

Additionally  O
  O
expression  O
of  O
the  O
synthetic  O
gene  O
clusters  O
for  O
bacillomycin    B-Chemical
L    I-Chemical
  O
surfactin    B-Chemical
  O
and  O
fengycin    B-Chemical
were  O
also  O
significantly  O
altered  O
.  O

γ    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
PGA    I-Chemical
and  O
the  O
LPs    B-Chemical
are  O
very  O
important  O
to  O
biofilm  O
formation  O
[  O
16  O
–  O
17  O
  O
39  O
].  O

Therefore  O
  O
we  O
proposed  O
that  O
gltB  O
regulates  O
biofilm  O
formation  O
via  O
a  O
γ    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
PGA    I-Chemical
-  O
dependent  O
pathway  O
and  O
the  O
production  O
of  O
the  O
three  O
LPs    B-Chemical
.  O

Our  O
results  O
strongly  O
suggested  O
that  O
disruption  O
of  O
gltB  O
resulted  O
in  O
impairment  O
of  O
the  O
ability  O
to  O
assimilate  O
glutamate    B-Chemical
and  O
led  O
to  O
decreased  O
γ    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
PGA    I-Chemical
biosynthesis  O
.  O

On  O
the  O
basis  O
that  O
γ    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
PGA    I-Chemical
was  O
able  O
to  O
restore  O
biofilm  O
formation  O
by  O
the  O
gltB  O
mutant  O
  O
we  O
concluded  O
that  O
γ    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
PGA    I-Chemical
plays  O
an  O
important  O
role  O
in  O
biofilm  O
formation  O
by  O
B  O
.  O
subtilis  O
916  O
.  O

As  O
we  O
reported  O
previously  O
  O
surfactin    B-Chemical
was  O
able  O
to  O
restore  O
the  O
biofilm  O
formation  O
of  O
a  O
bacillomycin    B-Chemical
L    I-Chemical
mutant  O
[  O
35  O
]  O
therefore  O
we  O
think  O
that  O
the  O
reduction  O
of  O
the  O
bacillomycin    B-Chemical
L    I-Chemical
level  O
in  O
the  O
ΔgltB  O
mutant  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
a  O
significant  O
influence  O
on  O
biofilm  O
formation  O
by  O
this  O
strain  O
because  O
its  O
increased  O
production  O
of  O
surfactin    B-Chemical
would  O
compensate  O
for  O
the  O
decrease  O
in  O
bacillomycin    B-Chemical
L    I-Chemical
.  O
In  O
general  O
  O
we  O
confirmed  O
that  O
disruption  O
of  O
gltB  O
led  O
to  O
deficiency  O
in  O
biofilm  O
formation  O
.  O

Colonization  O

is  O
a  O

Bacillomycin    B-Chemical
L    I-Chemical
and  O
fengycin    B-Chemical
are  O
the  O
main  O
contributors  O
to  O
the  O
antifungal  O
activity  O
of  O
B  O
.  O
subtilis  O
916  O
[  O
34  O
–  O
35  O
].  O

Surfactin    B-Chemical
is  O
main  O
agent  O
against  O
bacterial  O
pathogens  O
such  O
as  O
Pectobacterium  O
carotovorum  O
  O
Xanthomonas  O
campestris  O
and  O
Podosphaera  O
fusca  O
[  O
48  O
].  O

In  O
our  O
study  O
  O
we  O
conclusively  O
proved  O
that  O
production  O
of  O
γ    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
PGA    I-Chemical
contributed  O
to  O
biofilm  O
formation  O
and  O
verified  O
that  O
bacillomycin    B-Chemical
L    I-Chemical
and  O
fengycin    B-Chemical
contributed  O
to  O
the  O
antifungal  O
activity  O
of  O
B  O
.  O
subtilis  O
916  O
.  O

Using  O
confocal  O

to  O
detect  O
colonisation  O
of  O
ΔgltB  O
on  O
rice  O
plants  O
and  O
pot  O
experiments  O
to  O
determinate  O
its  O
biocontrol  O
efficiency  O
  O
we  O
showed  O
that  O
the  O
ΔgltB  O
mutant  O
demonstrated  O
poor  O
colonisation  O
  O
including  O
fewer  O
bacterial  O
cells  O
and  O
a  O
lack  O
of  O
significant  O
nutrient  O
chemotaxis  O
.  O

These  O
results  O
suggest  O
that  O
colonisation  O
by  O
B  O
.  O
subtilis  O
Bs916  O
was  O
regulated  O
by  O
GltB  O
  O
it  O
may  O
also  O
be  O
influenced  O
by  O
the  O
strength  O
of  O
the  O

and  O
the  O
level  O
of  O
γ    B-Chemical

[  O

].  O

The  O
ΔgltB  O
mutant  O
also  O
demonstrated  O
poor  O
biocontrol  O
efficiency  O
against  O
rice  O
sheath  O

.  O

So  O
  O
we  O
confirmed  O
that  O
biocontrol  O
efficiency  O
of  O
B  O

subtilis  O
Bs916  O
was  O
regulated  O
by  O

mainly  O
via  O
the  O
production  O
of  O
bacillomycin    B-Chemical

.  O

In  O
conclusion  O
  O
the  O

to  O

In  O

This  O

could  O
  O
not  O
only  O
verify  O
the  O

has  O
attracted  O
a  O
great  O

  O
since  O
the  O

the  O

significant  O
for  O
understanding  O
the  O

In  O
previous  O

  O
we  O

Because  O

In  O
previous  O

  O
it  O
was  O
shown  O
that  O
the  O
dynamic  O

of  O
DCP    B-Chemical

is  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O

of  O
that  O
of  O

the  O

  O
which  O
is  O
called  O
“  O

”.  O

This  O
conclusion  O
is  O
available  O
when  O
the  O

However  O
  O
the  O

be  O
broken  O
when  O

From  O

This  O

it  O
still  O
could  O

recognized  O
from  O
the  O

  O

As  O

  O

  O
the  O

but  O
it  O
is  O
broken  O
when  O
P  O

From  O
the  O

  O
it  O

that  O

Conclusions  O

In  O
this  O
study  O
  O
the  O
dynamic  O
potentials  O
of  O
highly  O
excited  O
vibrational  O
states  O
of  O
DCP    B-Chemical
with  O
an  O
harmonicity  O
and  O
Fermi  O
coupling  O
are  O
studied  O
.  O

The  O
results  O
show  O
that  O
the  O
D  O
–  O
C  O
–  O
P  O
bending  O
mode  O
has  O
weak  O
effects  O
on  O
D  O
–  O
C  O
and  O
C  O
–  O
P  O
stretching  O
mode  O
under  O
different  O
Polyad  O
numbers  O
.  O

Just  O
like  O
previous  O
studies  O
  O
it  O
is  O
found  O
that  O
the  O
vibrational  O
energy  O
levels  O
could  O
be  O
classified  O
by  O
the  O
quantum  O
environments  O
.  O

From  O
comparative  O
studies  O
  O
it  O
shows  O
that  O
the  O
uncoupled  O
modes  O
make  O
the  O
original  O
horizontal  O
reversed  O
symmetry  O
breaking  O
between  O
the  O
dynamic  O
potential  O
of  O
HCP    B-Chemical
()  O
and  O
DCP    B-Chemical
()  O
but  O
has  O
little  O
effect  O
on  O
the  O
vertical  O
symmetry  O
between  O
dynamic  O
potential  O
of  O
HCP    B-Chemical
()  O
and  O
DCP    B-Chemical
().  O

Considering  O
the  O
effect  O
of  O
in  O
DCP    B-Chemical
and  O
in  O
HCP    B-Chemical
  O
the  O
original  O
dynamic  O
similarities  O
in  O
these  O
two  O
systems  O
disappear  O
and  O
the  O
characteristics  O
of  O
symmetry  O
become  O
much  O
more  O
complex  O
.  O

The  O
above  O
results  O
show  O
that  O
the  O
method  O
which  O
enables  O
us  O
to  O
understand  O
the  O
DCP    B-Chemical
dynamics  O
simply  O
from  O
those  O
of  O
HCP    B-Chemical
without  O
repeated  O
elaboration  O
are  O
only  O
available  O
in  O
some  O
special  O
conditions  O
  O
and  O
  O
on  O
the  O
other  O
hand  O
  O
there  O
are  O
some  O
new  O
dynamic  O
symmetries  O
appearing  O
when  O
the  O
conditions  O
are  O
different  O
  O
which  O
indicate  O
that  O
the  O
homologous  O
compounds  O
are  O
intrinsically  O
similar  O
only  O
if  O
the  O
coupling  O
patterns  O

two  O

infections  O
might  O
influence  O
hepatic  O
glucose    B-Chemical
sensitivity  O
and  O
increase  O
insulin  O
resistance  O
[  O
5  O
]  O
which  O
could  O
be  O
determined  O
from  O
the  O
findings  O
that  O
diabetes  O
and  O
prediabetes  O
were  O
prevalent  O
among  O
HBV  O
-  O
infected  O
patients  O
[  O

].  O

HBV  O
infection  O
is  O
the  O
tenth  O
leading  O
cause  O
of  O
death  O
worldwide  O
  O
with  O
about  O
786  O
  O
0  O
related  O
deaths  O
every  O
year  O
[  O
7  O
].  O

Therefore  O
  O
HBV  O
infection  O
causes  O
high  O
mortality  O
and  O
creates  O
a  O
social  O
burden  O
.  O

Bilirubin    B-Chemical
  O
a  O
primary  O
end  O
product  O
of  O
heme    B-Chemical
catabolism  O
  O
processes  O
cytoprotective  O
properties  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
antioxidant  O
nature  O
of  O
the  O
bile  O
pigment  O
.  O

In  O
1995  O
  O
it  O
was  O
first  O
suggested  O
by  O
Breimer  O
that  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
might  O
be  O
implicated  O
in  O
the  O
protection  O
of  O
specific  O
kinds  O
of  O
diseases  O
resulting  O
from  O
oxidative  O
damage  O
[  O
8  O
].  O

Then  O
  O
as  O
observed  O
by  O
related  O
reports  O
  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
appeared  O
to  O
have  O
the  O
innate  O
capacity  O
to  O
resist  O
oxidative  O
damage  O
[  O
9  O
  O
10  O
  O
11  O
].  O

Meanwhile  O
  O
all  O
patterns  O
of  O
serum  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
  O
including  O
total  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
(  O
TBil    B-Chemical
)  O
direct  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
(  O
DBil    B-Chemical
)  O
and  O
indirect  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
(  O
IBil    B-Chemical
)  O
display  O
protective  O
properties  O
in  O
cardiovascular  O
diseases  O
[  O
12  O
].  O

Several  O
studies  O
clarified  O
that  O
the  O
robust  O
anti  O
-  O
oxidative  O
properties  O
of  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
could  O
largely  O
explain  O
its  O
protective  O
effects  O
[  O
13  O
  O
14  O
  O
15  O
]  O
and  O
the  O
findings  O
that  O
subjects  O
with  O
higher  O
serum  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
had  O
elevated  O
total  O
antioxidant  O
status  O
also  O
confirmed  O
its  O
anti  O
-  O
oxidative  O
property  O
[  O
16  O
].  O

On  O
the  O
other  O
hand  O
  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
has  O
previously  O
been  O
proven  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
marker  O
of  O
liver  O
injury  O
and  O
is  O
incorporated  O
in  O
several  O
prognostic  O
scoring  O
models  O
  O
such  O
as  O
the  O
Child  O
–  O
Pugh  O
(  O
CP  O
)  O
score  O
and  O
the  O
model  O
of  O
end  O
-  O
stage  O
liver  O
disease  O
(  O
MELD  O
)  O
[  O

].  O

In  O
recent  O
years  O
  O
relevant  O
studies  O
focused  O
on  O
the  O
effect  O
of  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
on  O
several  O
hepatic  O
disorders  O
.  O

Recent  O
study  O
suggested  O
that  O
DBil    B-Chemical
independently  O
reduced  O
non  O

alcoholic  O
fatty  O
liver  O
disease  O
(  O
NAFLD  O
)  O
risk  O
[  O
18  O
].  O

Patients  O
who  O
were  O
with  O
liver  O
biopsy  O
-  O
proved  O
non  O

alcoholic  O
steatohepatitis  O
(  O
NASH  O
)  O
had  O
significantly  O
lower  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
levels  O
compared  O
with  O
those  O
without  O
NASH  O
  O
and  O
there  O
was  O
also  O
an  O
inverse  O
association  O
between  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
levels  O
and  O
histological  O
features  O
including  O
fibrosis  O
[  O
19  O
  O
20  O
].  O

Serum  O
IBil    B-Chemical
levels  O
were  O
negatively  O
correlated  O
with  O
the  O
progression  O
of  O
liver  O
fibrosis  O
in  O
chronic  O
hepatitis  O
C  O
(  O
CHC  O
)  O
patients  O
[  O
21  O
].  O

However  O
  O
the  O
concentrations  O
of  O
serum  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
increased  O
along  O
with  O
the  O
increased  O
severity  O
of  O
fibrosis  O
among  O
CHC  O
patients  O
[  O
22  O
].  O

High  O
levels  O
of  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
or  O
combined  O
prognostic  O
index  O
including  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
were  O
able  O
to  O
predict  O
short  O

mortality  O
in  O
the  O
patients  O
with  O
acute  O
-  O
on  O
-  O
chronic  O
liver  O
failure  O
[  O
23  O
  O
24  O
].  O

Meantime  O
  O
abnormal  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
values  O
were  O
even  O
more  O
strongly  O
associated  O
with  O
poor  O
clinical  O
outcome  O
at  O
baseline  O
and  O
up  O
to  O
five  O
years  O
follow  O
-  O
up  O
in  O
the  O
patients  O
with  O
primary  O
billiary  O

[  O

].  O

Related  O
studies  O
have  O
illustrated  O
the  O
associations  O
between  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
and  O
liver  O
disease  O
.  O

However  O
  O
the  O
study  O
which  O
is  O
performed  O
on  O
participants  O
with  O
HBV  O
infection  O
is  O
lacking  O
.  O

Secondly  O
  O
the  O
most  O
of  O
these  O
studies  O
did  O
not  O
investigate  O
the  O
associations  O
between  O
all  O
subtypes  O
of  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
and  O
liver  O
disease  O
.  O

Finally  O
  O
the  O
study  O
that  O
assesses  O
the  O
relationship  O
between  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
and  O
HBV  O
-  O
related  O

based  O
on  O
large  O
sample  O
sizes  O
might  O

the  O
apparently  O
bewildering  O
complexity  O
of  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical

to  O
be  O

.  O

The  O
task  O
for  O
this  O
study  O
is  O
to  O
untangle  O
the  O

Discussion  O

In  O
this  O
study  O
  O
we  O
observed  O
the  O
significant  O
differences  O
in  O
serum  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
between  O
individuals  O
with  O
or  O
without  O
HBV  O
infection  O
.  O

Moreover  O
  O
higher  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
levels  O
might  O
indicate  O
more  O
advanced  O
liver  O
fibrosis  O
in  O
a  O
large  O
group  O
of  O
retired  O
workers  O
with  O
serum  O
evidence  O
of  O
HBV  O
infection  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
  O
such  O
associations  O
were  O
statistically  O
significant  O
when  O
adjusted  O
for  O
multiple  O
parameters  O
  O
especially  O
in  O
female  O
  O
overweight  O
or  O
central  O
fat  O
distribution  O
individuals  O
.  O

Our  O
observations  O
could  O
probably  O
best  O
explain  O
the  O
relationship  O
between  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
and  O
validated  O
non  O
-  O
invasive  O
fibrosis  O
indices  O
among  O
HBV  O
carriers  O
.  O

For  O
a  O
start  O
  O
a  O
lower  O
prevalence  O
of  O
traditional  O
cardiovascular  O
risk  O
factors  O
like  O
hypertension  O
  O
diabetes  O
  O
CHD  O
and  O
fatty  O
liver  O
was  O
observed  O
in  O
the  O
report  O
  O
which  O
was  O
different  O
from  O
the  O
findings  O
that  O
diabetes  O
and  O
prediabetes  O
were  O
prevalent  O
among  O
HBV  O
-  O
infected  O
patients  O
[  O
6  O
].  O

One  O
possible  O
reason  O
for  O
this  O
would  O
be  O
the  O
distinct  O
characteristics  O
of  O
the  O
two  O
study  O
groups  O
.  O

Following  O
the  O
phenomenon  O
that  O
the  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
levels  O
among  O
HBV  O
carriers  O
were  O
higher  O
than  O
the  O
others  O
  O
we  O
sought  O
to  O
investigate  O
the  O
relationship  O
between  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
and  O
the  O
liver  O
fibrosis  O
among  O
individuals  O
with  O
HBV  O
infection  O
.  O

Unlike  O
the  O
meaningful  O
findings  O
that  O
higher  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
concentrations  O
were  O
associated  O
with  O
reduced  O
risk  O
of  O
cardiovascular  O
disease  O
  O
respiratory  O
illness  O
and  O
mortality  O
in  O
epidemiological  O
studies  O
[  O
13  O
  O
15  O
]  O
the  O
protective  O
effect  O
of  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
was  O
not  O
meaningful  O
in  O
our  O
study  O
.  O

Similar  O
tendency  O
was  O
observed  O
in  O
patients  O
with  O
hepatitis  O
C  O
virus  O
(  O
HCV  O
)  O
associated  O
fibrosis  O
[  O
22  O
]  O
but  O
the  O
concentrations  O
of  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
in  O
this  O
study  O
were  O
far  O
beyond  O
the  O
”  O
normal  O
range  O
”.  O

Conversely  O
  O
the  O
principal  O
results  O
in  O
our  O
study  O
were  O
different  O
from  O
another  O
HCV  O
-  O
related  O
fibrosis  O
study  O
[  O
21  O
]  O
in  O
which  O
the  O
inverse  O
relationship  O
between  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
and  O
liver  O
fibrosis  O
was  O
found  O
.  O

The  O
possible  O
reasons  O
for  O
the  O
inconsistent  O
results  O
of  O
the  O
researches  O
above  O
might  O
be  O
the  O
sample  O
size  O
and  O
diverse  O
study  O
design  O
.  O

The  O
results  O
presented  O
indicated  O
that  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
might  O
act  O
as  O
an  O
independent  O
risk  O
factor  O
for  O
significant  O
liver  O
fibrosis  O
.  O

Is  O
this  O
biologically  O
plausible  O
?  O

The  O
process  O
of  O
liver  O
fibrosis  O
is  O
the  O
excessive  O
accumulation  O
of  O
extracellular  O
matrix  O
proteins  O
including  O
collagen  O
.  O

Most  O
types  O
of  O
chronic  O
liver  O
disease  O
without  O
clinical  O
symptoms  O
have  O
developed  O
into  O
liver  O
fibrosis  O
which  O
could  O
result  O
in  O
cirrhosis  O
  O
liver  O
failure  O
  O
and  O
other  O
severe  O
complications  O
.  O

In  O
advanced  O
cirrhosis  O
  O
glucuronyl  O
conjugation  O
of  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
and  O
biliary  O
excretion  O
of  O
DBil    B-Chemical
are  O
markedly  O
impaired  O
and  O
jaundice  O
appears  O
[  O
26  O
].  O

Therefore  O
  O
the  O
concentration  O
of  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
in  O
serum  O
may  O
be  O
a  O
good  O
prognostic  O
marker  O
for  O
patients  O
with  O
decompensated  O
liver  O
cirrhosis  O
.  O

Hepatic  O
fibrosis  O
  O
as  O
the  O
onset  O
of  O
liver  O
cirrhosis  O
  O
might  O
disturb  O
the  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
’  O
s  O
normal  O
production  O
and  O
excretion  O
in  O
the  O
liver  O
.  O

Although  O
it  O
is  O
difficult  O
to  O
determine  O
the  O
exact  O
mechanisms  O
behind  O
the  O
relationship  O
between  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
and  O
fibrotic  O
progression  O
because  O
of  O
complexity  O
of  O
the  O
disease  O
  O
several  O
hints  O
could  O
be  O
identified  O
.  O

Firstly  O
  O
related  O
studies  O
proposed  O
that  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
was  O
able  O
to  O
induce  O
cytotoxic  O
effects  O
[  O
27  O
  O
28  O
  O
29  O
  O
30  O
]  O
unbalance  O
the  O
redox  O
homeostasis  O
[  O
31  O
]  O
and  O
finally  O
affect  O
the  O
mitochondrial  O
integrity  O
and  O
induce  O
apoptosis  O
[  O
32  O
].  O

Second  O
  O
activated  O
retinoid    B-Chemical
-  O
storing  O
hepatic  O
stellate  O
cells  O
might  O
contribute  O
more  O
to  O
the  O
elevation  O
of  O
DBil    B-Chemical
levels  O
in  O
blood  O
[  O
33  O
]  O
and  O
the  O
medicine  O
associated  O
with  O
reversion  O
and  O
prevention  O
of  O
cirrhosis  O
could  O
also  O
reduce  O
the  O
levels  O
of  O
serum  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
[  O
34  O
].  O

Lastly  O
  O
slightly  O
elevated  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
could  O
induce  O
a  O
stress  O
response  O
to  O
the  O
endoplasmic  O
reticulum  O
  O
resulting  O
in  O
a  O
decreased  O
proliferative  O
and  O
metabolic  O
activity  O
of  O
hepatocytes  O
[  O
35  O
].  O

Three  O
important  O
findings  O
were  O
achieved  O
about  O
evaluating  O
serum  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
in  O
individuals  O
with  O
HBV  O
infection  O
.  O

First  O
  O
our  O
results  O
showed  O
the  O
positive  O
associations  O
between  O
all  O
forms  O
of  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
and  O
severity  O
of  O
liver  O
disease  O
.  O

DBil    B-Chemical
was  O
more  O
correlative  O
with  O
the  O
indices  O
of  O
liver  O
fibrosis  O
.  O

Also  O
  O
DBil    B-Chemical
had  O
higher  O
AUROCs  O
than  O
TBil    B-Chemical
and  O
IBil    B-Chemical
.  O

To  O
be  O
noticed  O
  O
there  O
were  O
slight  O
differences  O
between  O
DBil    B-Chemical
and  O
IBil    B-Chemical
.  O

IBil    B-Chemical
had  O
more  O
potent  O
anti  O
-  O
oxidant  O
capacity  O
than  O
the  O
DBil    B-Chemical
[  O
36  O
]  O
might  O
explain  O
the  O
weaker  O
association  O
between  O
IBil    B-Chemical
and  O
the  O
risk  O
of  O
elevated  O
fibrosis  O
indices  O
.  O

Second  O
  O
our  O
results  O
suggested  O
that  O
females  O
should  O
pay  O
more  O
attention  O
to  O
an  O
increase  O
of  O
DBil    B-Chemical
level  O
.  O

Related  O
study  O
suggested  O
a  O
protective  O
effect  O
of  O
estrogens  O
on  O
fibrogenesis  O
via  O
the  O
inhibition  O
of  O
stellate  O
cell  O
proliferation  O
[  O
37  O
].  O

The  O
individuals  O
in  O
the  O
current  O
study  O
were  O
featured  O
with  O
old  O
age  O
and  O
estrogens  O
levels  O
were  O
substantially  O
decreased  O
.  O

The  O
findings  O
suggested  O
that  O
elderly  O
females  O
should  O
pay  O
more  O
attention  O
to  O
the  O
increase  O
in  O
DBil    B-Chemical
.  O

In  O
addition  O
  O
overweight  O
subjects  O
and  O
those  O
with  O
central  O
fat  O
distribution  O
should  O
also  O
be  O
careful  O
of  O
an  O
increase  O
in  O
DBil    B-Chemical
level  O
.  O

The  O
intricate  O
interplay  O
between  O
HBV  O
infection  O
and  O
metabolic  O
factors  O
might  O
be  O
involved  O
in  O
the  O
positive  O
relationship  O
between  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
and  O
fibrosis  O
[  O
38  O
].  O

The  O
data  O
in  O
the  O
present  O
study  O
confirmed  O
this  O
idea  O
which  O
the  O
participants  O
with  O
higher  O
DBil    B-Chemical
levels  O
had  O
higher  O
risks  O
of  O
elevated  O
fibrosis  O
scores  O
among  O
subjects  O
with  O
central  O
fat  O
distribution  O
or  O
overweight  O
compared  O
to  O
those  O
without  O
such  O
metabolic  O
disorders  O
.  O

Lifestyle  O
advice  O
should  O
be  O
offered  O
to  O
all  O
HBsAg  O
carriers  O
due  O
to  O
its  O
easy  O
implementation  O
with  O
little  O
risk  O
of  O
side  O
-  O
effects  O
or  O
cost  O
.  O

The  O
data  O
displayed  O
here  O
can  O
be  O
explained  O
only  O
in  O
the  O
context  O
of  O
the  O
study  O
design  O
.  O

Firstly  O
  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
limitations  O
of  O
the  O
cross  O
-  O
sectional  O
study  O
  O
the  O
potentially  O
important  O
function  O
of  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
needed  O

of  O
liver  O
fibrosis  O
was  O
assessed  O
only  O
by  O
noninvasive  O
indices  O
.  O

Although  O
liver  O
pathology  O
is  O
the  O
gold  O
standard  O
  O
patients  O
’  O
discomfort  O
and  O
expense  O
should  O
be  O
considered  O
also  O
.  O

Noninvasive  O
methods  O
had  O
overcome  O
the  O
limitations  O
of  O
liver  O
biopsy  O
and  O
were  O
also  O
used  O
as  O
prognostic  O
indices  O
for  O
subjects  O
with  O
hepatitis  O
B  O
-  O
associated  O
HCC  O
[  O
39  O
].  O

Furthermore  O
  O
the  O
accuracy  O
of  O
FIB  O
-  O
4  O
and  O
APRI  O
were  O
78  O
%  O
and  O
76  O
%  O
[  O
40  O
]  O
suggesting  O
they  O
were  O
suitable  O
for  O
regular  O
monitoring  O
of  O
disease  O
progression  O
[  O
41  O
  O
42  O
].  O

Thus  O
  O
using  O
APRI  O
and  O
FIB  O
-  O
4  O
to  O
assess  O
liver  O
fibrosis  O
was  O
acceptable  O
in  O
the  O
circumstances  O
of  O
the  O
study  O
.  O

Finally  O
  O
we  O
failed  O
to  O
acquire  O
information  O
on  O
concentrations  O
of  O
virus  O
titer  O
that  O
were  O
potentially  O
linked  O
to  O
the  O
pathophysiology  O
of  O
CHB  O
.  O

The  O
proportion  O
of  O
HBeAg  O
(+)  O
was  O
1  O
.  O
8  O
%  O
and  O
relatively  O
small  O
in  O
the  O
study  O
.  O

In  O
summary  O
  O
our  O
study  O
demonstrates  O
a  O
robust  O
association  O
between  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
levels  O
and  O
higher  O
surrogate  O
indices  O
of  O
liver  O
fibrosis  O
among  O
participants  O
with  O
HBV  O
infection  O
.  O

This  O
suggests  O
that  O
bilirubin    B-Chemical
levels  O
  O
especially  O
DBil    B-Chemical
  O
were  O
independently  O
associated  O
with  O
an  O

risk  O
of  O
increased  O

indices  O

  O
it  O
was  O
uncertain  O
what  O
the  O
physiological  O

would  O
be  O
  O
so  O
we  O
took  O
a  O
reverse  O
genetic  O
approach  O
to  O
address  O
this  O
.  O

We  O
had  O
already  O
established  O
that  O
blocking  O
the  O
GlgE  O
pathway  O
with  O
a  O
treS  O

did  O
not  O
affect  O
growth  O
of  O

on  O

or  O
minimal  O
media  O
supplemented  O
with  O
maltose    B-Chemical
(  O

).  O

This  O
was  O
because  O
the  O
product  O
of  O
TreS  O
  O
maltose    B-Chemical
  O
bypassed  O
the  O
blockage  O
(  O
Fig  O

).  O

Similarly  O
  O
when  O
the  O

was  O
replaced  O
by  O
an  O

  O
the  O
resulting  O

was  O
also  O
able  O
to  O
grow  O
on  O

supplemented  O
with  O
maltose    B-Chemical
  O
just  O
like  O
the  O
wild  O

type  O
strain  O
.  O

Metabolite  O
analysis  O
using  O
NMR  O
spectroscopy  O
showed  O
that  O
trehalose    B-Chemical
levels  O
were  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
wild  O
type  O
(  O
8  O
)  O
throughout  O
growth  O
on  O
maltose    B-Chemical
.  O

Although  O
the  O
maltose    B-Chemical
level  O
reached  O
4  O
%  O

during  O
growth  O

to  O

.  O

No  O
other  O

in  O

were  O

Therefore  O
  O
there  O
the  O

not  O
show  O
any  O

We  O
then  O

whether  O
a  O

could  O
be  O
observed  O
when  O
the  O

was  O

Although  O
no  O

of  O
the  O

was  O
observed  O
when  O
using  O

  O
there  O
was  O

Interestingly  O
  O
the  O

was  O
dependent  O
on  O

were  O

To  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
isolate  O
larger  O
quantities  O
of  O
cells  O
  O
the  O
mutant  O
was  O
grown  O
on  O
a  O

that  O
contained  O
both  O
galactose    B-Chemical

  O
the  O
latter  O
providing  O
some  O
maltose    B-Chemical
.  O

A  O
delayed  O

was  O
still  O
observed  O
  O
but  O
sporulation  O
did  O
eventually  O
occur  O
(  O
Fig  O

).  O

With  O
this  O
growth  O
medium  O
  O
the  O
mutant  O
strain  O
was  O
able  O
to  O
generate  O
some  O
trehalose    B-Chemical

probably  O

or  O
possibly  O
via  O

(  O

).  O

However  O
  O
the  O
spores  O
of  O
the  O

contained  O
less  O
trehalose    B-Chemical
(  O

This  O
suggested  O
that  O
the  O

amount  O
of  O

present  O
in  O
the  O

was  O
not  O

a  O

of  O
GalU  O
from  O
other  O

(  O
also  O
known  O
as  O
GtaB  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
normally  O
associated  O
with  O
the  O
formation  O
of  O
UDP    B-Chemical

glucose    I-Chemical
.  O

Enzyme  O
assays  O
that  O
monitor  O
the  O
production  O
of  O
pyrophosphate    B-Chemical
showed  O
that  O
SVEN_3027  O
did  O
possess  O
NDP  O
-  O
glucose  O
pyrophosphorylase  O
activity  O
such  O
that  O
the  O

≫  O

>  O

Therefore  O
  O
this  O
enzyme  O
does  O
indeed  O
possess  O
primarily  O
GalU  O
/  O
GtaB  O
-  O
type  O

and  O
is  O
not  O
an  O

Second  O
  O
SVEN_3972  O

isolated  O
as  O
a  O

enzyme  O
  O
according  O
to  O

  O
that  O
was  O
able  O
to  O

from  O

plus  O

(  O

It  O
seemed  O
at  O
first  O
to  O
be  O
quite  O

because  O
it  O
was  O
inactive  O
with  O

However  O
  O
it  O
turned  O
out  O
to  O
be  O
most  O
active  O
with  O
mannose    B-Chemical

-    I-Chemical
phosphate    I-Chemical
plus  O
either  O

or  O

The  O
highest  O

was  O
with  O

and  O
mannose    B-Chemical

By  O

  O
the  O

with  O
which  O
it  O
generated  O

was  O
over  O
100  O

  O
so  O
its  O

The  O

of  O

was  O
confirmed  O
using  O

However  O
  O
SVEN_2781  O
also  O

This  O
was  O
perhaps  O
to  O
be  O

it  O
shared  O

of  O

  O
the  O

went  O
to  O
completion  O

This  O
showed  O
that  O
the  O

strongly  O
in  O

of  O
the  O

The  O

Discussion  O

We  O
have  O
now  O
shown  O
that  O
S  O
.  O
venezuelae  O
OtsA  O
has  O
a  O
preference  O
for  O
GDP    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
glucose    I-Chemical
as  O
the  O
donor  O
(  O
Table  O
1  O
)  O
as  O
has  O
been  O
reported  O
for  O
OtsA  O
enzymes  O
from  O
other  O
Streptomyces  O
species  O
(  O
15  O

17  O
)  O
and  O
other  O
actinomycetes  O
  O
such  O
as  O
Rubrobacter  O
xylanophilus  O
(  O
18  O
).  O

Interestingly  O
  O
not  O
all  O
examples  O
of  O
OtsA  O
from  O
actinomycetes  O
share  O
this  O
donor  O
specificity  O
because  O
the  O
enzymes  O
from  O
mycobacteria  O
show  O
a  O
preference  O
for  O
ADP    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
glucose    I-Chemical
(  O
27  O
  O
34  O
  O
35  O
).  O

The  O
best  O
characterized  O
OtsA  O
enzyme  O
to  O
date  O
has  O
been  O
that  O
from  O
E  O
.  O
coli  O
  O
which  O
has  O
a  O
preference  O
for  O
UDP    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
glucose    I-Chemical
.  O

Several  O
ligand  O
-  O
bound  O
structures  O
have  O
allowed  O
the  O
residues  O
that  O
define  O
its  O
base  O
specificity  O
to  O
be  O
identified  O
(  O
Fig  O
.  O

)  O
(  O

).  O

Our  O
structure  O
of  O
the  O
enzyme  O
from  O
S  O
.  O
venezuelae  O
shows  O
that  O
these  O
defining  O
residues  O
are  O
not  O
conserved  O
.  O

By  O
contrast  O
  O
the  O
equivalent  O
residues  O
that  O
define  O
the  O
donor  O
base  O
specificity  O
of  O
VldE  O
(  O
29  O
)  O
which  O
uses  O
GDP    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
valienol    I-Chemical
  O
are  O
similar  O
in  O
S  O
.  O
venezuelae  O
OtsA  O
.  O

This  O
helps  O
explain  O
why  O
the  O
S  O
.  O
venezuelae  O
enzyme  O
shows  O
specificity  O
for  O
purine    B-Chemical
bases  O
  O
with  O
guanine    B-Chemical
being  O
preferred  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
  O
both  O
open  O
and  O
closed  O
conformations  O
of  O
E  O
.  O
coli  O
OtsA  O
and  O
VldE  O
have  O
been  O
described  O
  O
where  O
ligands  O
tend  O
to  O
promote  O
the  O
open  O
form  O
(  O
20  O
  O
21  O
  O
29  O
  O
36  O
).  O

Our  O
structure  O
of  O
S  O
.  O
venezuelae  O
OtsA  O
most  O
closely  O
resembles  O
the  O
open  O
conformations  O
despite  O
not  O
having  O
any  O
ligands  O
bound  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
lack  O
of  O
electron  O
density  O
associated  O
with  O
a  O
loop  O
comprising  O
amino    B-Chemical
acids    I-Chemical
18  O
–  O
22  O
(  O
peptide  O
sequence  O
GEDGE  O
)  O
of  O
the  O
S  O
.  O
venezuelae  O
enzyme  O
  O
implying  O
disorder  O
in  O
this  O
region  O
.  O

This  O
loop  O
is  O
topologically  O
in  O
a  O
similar  O
position  O
to  O
a  O
loop  O
known  O
to  O
interact  O
with  O
the  O
acceptor  O
substrate  O
in  O
the  O
E  O
.  O
coli  O
enzyme  O
that  O
can  O
be  O
disordered  O
in  O
crystals  O
lacking  O
an  O
acceptor  O
bound  O
to  O
the  O
active  O
site  O
(  O
21  O
).  O

It  O
is  O
therefore  O
conceivable  O
that  O
when  O
ligands  O
are  O
bound  O
  O
the  O
S  O
.  O
venezuelae  O
enzyme  O
adopts  O
a  O
different  O
conformation  O
  O
and  O
the  O
GEDGE  O
loop  O
forms  O
ordered  O
contacts  O
with  O
the  O
acceptor  O
substrate  O
.  O

An  O
otsA  O
null  O
mutant  O
of  O
S  O
.  O
venezuelae  O
exhibits  O
no  O
phenotype  O
when  O
grown  O
on  O
maltose    B-Chemical
because  O
this  O
GlgE  O
pathway  O
intermediate  O
bypasses  O
the  O
need  O
for  O
OtsA  O
to  O
generate  O
trehalose    B-Chemical
(  O
Fig  O
.  O

1  O
).  O

However  O
  O
when  O
grown  O
on  O
galactose    B-Chemical
  O
the  O
mutant  O
accumulates  O
GDP    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
glucose    I-Chemical
(  O
Fig  O
.  O

5  O
)  O
showing  O
that  O
OtsA  O
would  O
normally  O
utilize  O
this  O
donor  O
substrate  O
  O
although  O
it  O
is  O
also  O
capable  O
of  O
using  O
ADP    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
glucose    I-Chemical
to  O
some  O
extent  O
(  O
Table  O
1  O
).  O

Then  O
again  O
  O
S  O
.  O
venezuelae  O
does  O
not  O
possess  O
an  O
obvious  O
glgC  O
homologue  O
that  O
would  O
code  O
for  O
an  O
ADP  O
-  O
glucose  O
pyrophosphorylase  O
(  O
5  O
  O
8  O
)  O
implying  O
that  O
this  O
organism  O
cannot  O
produce  O
ADP    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
glucose    I-Chemical
.  O

The  O
accumulation  O
of  O
both  O
glucose    B-Chemical
1    I-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
phosphate    I-Chemical
and  O
galactose    B-Chemical
1    I-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
phosphate    I-Chemical
is  O
consistent  O
with  O
this  O
organism  O
assimilating  O
galactose    B-Chemical
via  O
a  O
Leloir  O
-  O
type  O
pathway  O
(  O
31  O
).  O

What  O
was  O
more  O
unexpected  O
was  O
the  O
cell  O
density  O
-  O
dependent  O
growth  O
phenotype  O
of  O
the  O
mutant  O
when  O
grown  O
on  O
galactose    B-Chemical
(  O
Fig  O
.  O

4  O
).  O

The  O
accumulation  O
of  O
maltose    B-Chemical
1    I-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
phosphate    I-Chemical
is  O
known  O
to  O
lead  O
to  O
a  O
delayed  O
growth  O
phenotype  O
in  O
S  O
.  O
venezuelae  O
  O
but  O
a  O
lack  O
of  O
α    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
glucan    I-Chemical
has  O
no  O
effect  O
(  O
8  O
).  O

More  O
dramatically  O
  O
the  O
accumulation  O
of  O
maltose    B-Chemical
1    I-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
phosphate    I-Chemical
causes  O
bacterial  O
cell  O
death  O
in  O
M  O
.  O
tuberculosis  O
(  O
4  O
).  O

It  O
is  O
therefore  O
possible  O
that  O
the  O
accumulation  O
of  O
glucose    B-Chemical
1    I-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
phosphate    I-Chemical
and  O
galactose    B-Chemical
1    I-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
phosphate    I-Chemical
slows  O
growth  O
in  O
S  O
.  O
venezuelae  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
  O
the  O
accumulation  O
of  O
ADP    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
glucose    I-Chemical
appears  O
to  O
be  O
lethal  O
in  O
M  O
.  O
tuberculosis  O
(  O
37  O
)  O
so  O
perhaps  O
it  O
is  O
the  O
accumulation  O
of  O
GDP    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
glucose    I-Chemical
that  O
actually  O
slows  O
the  O
growth  O
of  O
S  O
.  O
venezuelae  O
.  O

Either  O
way  O
  O
it  O
is  O
intriguing  O
that  O
the  O
phenotype  O
is  O
cell  O
density  O
-  O
dependent  O
.  O

Perhaps  O
these  O
or  O
some  O
other  O
toxic  O
metabolites  O
are  O
exported  O
out  O
of  O
cells  O
.  O

Alternatively  O
  O
perhaps  O
some  O
nutrients  O
in  O
the  O
solid  O
medium  O
become  O
locally  O
limiting  O
or  O
metabolic  O
fluxes  O
are  O
influenced  O
by  O
quorum  O
sensing  O
.  O

Further  O
studies  O
will  O
be  O
required  O
to  O
establish  O
the  O
basis  O
for  O
the  O
growth  O
phenotype  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
now  O
clear  O
that  O
S  O
.  O
venezuelae  O
OtsA  O
utilizes  O
GDP    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
glucose    I-Chemical
both  O
in  O
vitro  O
and  O
in  O
vivo  O
.  O

We  O
therefore  O
sought  O
an  O
enzyme  O
that  O
is  O
capable  O
of  O
generating  O
this  O
donor  O
substrate  O
.  O

With  O
the  O
absence  O
of  O
a  O
known  O
sequence  O
being  O
associated  O
with  O
such  O
an  O
enzyme  O
  O
we  O
tested  O
three  O
candidate  O
enzymes  O
based  O
on  O
homology  O
with  O
the  O
potentially  O
similar  O
GDP  O
-  O
mannose  O
pyrophosphorylases  O
.  O

SVEN_3027  O
generated  O
UDP    B-Chemical

glucose    I-Chemical
as  O
expected  O
  O
given  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
also  O
a  O

of  O

from  O
other  O

(  O
33  O
  O
38  O
).  O

SVEN_3972  O
  O
on  O
the  O
other  O
hand  O
  O
was  O
somewhat  O
unusual  O
because  O
its  O
main  O
activity  O
appeared  O
to  O
be  O
associated  O
with  O
the  O
production  O
of  O
IDP    B-Chemical
-    I-Chemical
mannose    I-Chemical
(  O
Table  O
3  O
).  O

Such  O
an  O
activity  O
has  O
rarely  O
been  O
reported  O
(  O
39  O
).  O

The  O
values  O
of  O
kcat  O
/  O
Km  O
with  O
this  O
enzyme  O
were  O
quite  O
low  O
(  O
40  O
).  O

This  O
implies  O
that  O
either  O
the  O
enzyme  O
is  O
inherently  O
not  O
very  O
efficient  O
or  O
its  O
primary  O
role  O
is  O
to  O
generate  O
another  O

that  O

not  O

been  O

SVEN_2781  O
was  O

to  O
generate  O

to  O
SVEN_2781  O
  O

The  O

  O
it  O

therefore  O

the  O

(  O

There  O
remains  O
the  O
possibility  O
that  O
there  O
are  O

Gratifyingly  O
  O
the  O

improved  O

However  O
  O

In  O

  O

observed  O
when  O

The  O
purpose  O
of  O
this  O
study  O
was  O
to  O
further  O
test  O
the  O
procognitive  O
effects  O
of  O
NAAG  O
peptidase  O
inhibition  O
across  O
models  O
of  O
normal  O

and  O
in  O
clinically  O
relevant  O
models  O
of  O
cognitive  O
deficits  O
.  O

In  O
parallel  O
  O
the  O
goal  O
was  O
to  O
test  O
the  O
hypothesis  O
that  O
these  O
procognitive  O
effects  O
are  O
mediated  O
by  O
NAAG    B-Chemical
activation  O
of  O
the  O
group  O

While  O
many  O

reported  O
to  O
demonstrate  O

  O
there  O
are  O
no  O

Similarly  O
  O
the  O
mGluR2  O

in  O
this  O

had  O
procognitive  O
activity  O
in  O
the  O
24  O

test  O
[].  O

Both  O
of  O
these  O
actions  O
were  O
blocked  O
by  O
the  O
group  O
II  O
mGluR  O
antagonist  O
LY341495    B-Chemical
  O
consistent  O
with  O
a  O
series  O
of  O
studies  O
that  O
support  O
the  O
conclusion  O
that  O
the  O
peptide  O
mediates  O
group  O
II  O
mGluR  O
activation  O
[  O

The  O
finding  O
that  O
the  O
procognitive  O

and  O
ZJ43    B-Chemical
in  O

mGluR2  O

not  O
mGluR3  O

mice  O
(  O

supports  O
the  O
conclusion  O
that  O
mGluR3  O
is  O
the  O
group  O
II  O
receptor  O
mediating  O
these  O
procognitive  O
actions  O
.  O

This  O
conclusion  O
is  O
further  O
strengthened  O
by  O
the  O
efficacy  O
of  O

A  O
similar  O
result  O
in  O

Central  O
to  O
the  O
conclusion  O
that  O
these  O
effects  O
of  O
the  O
peptidase  O
inhibitors  O
are  O
mediated  O
by  O
the  O
activation  O
of  O
mGluR3  O
by  O
elevated  O
levels  O
of  O
synaptically  O
released  O
NAAG    B-Chemical

rather  O
than  O
by  O
the  O
drugs  O

the  O

that  O

not  O
activate  O

These  O
data  O
on  O
the  O
mGluR3  O
mediated  O
procognitive  O
actions  O
of  O
NAAG  O
peptidase  O
inhibition  O
also  O
are  O
consistent  O
with  O
the  O
broader  O
hypothesis  O
that  O
this  O
receptor  O
plays  O
a  O
more  O
general  O
role  O
in  O
memory  O
formation  O

One  O
potential  O

to  O
use  O

  O
because  O

These  O

an  O

Similarly  O
  O
it  O
can  O
be  O
envisioned  O
that  O

would  O

Conclusions  O

CF  O
and  O
secretory  O
diarrhea  O
are  O
two  O
major  O
human  O
diseases  O
associated  O
with  O
dysregulated  O
CFTR  O
channel  O
activities  O
.  O

Since  O
the  O
discovery  O
of  O
the  O
CFTR  O
gene  O
in  O
1989  O
  O
significant  O
progress  O
has  O
been  O
made  O
in  O
understanding  O
the  O
CF  O
pathogenesis  O
and  O
in  O
development  O
of  O
effective  O
CF  O
therapies  O
.  O

The  O
approval  O
of  O
Kalydeco  O
®  O
and  O
Orkambi  O
®  O
has  O
proven  O
that  O
CFTR  O
is  O
a  O
validated  O
drug  O
target  O
.  O

Because  O
the  O
channel  O
function  O
of  O
CFTR  O
is  O
regulated  O
by  O
dynamic  O
protein  O
–  O
protein  O
interactions  O
in  O
a  O
complex  O
network  O
  O
identification  O
of  O
these  O
CFTR  O
-  O
containing  O
macromolecular  O
complexes  O
can  O
further  O
our  O
understanding  O
of  O
CFTR  O
biology  O
in  O
health  O
and  O
in  O
disease  O
  O
and  O
open  O
up  O
potential  O
avenues  O
for  O
drug  O
development  O
to  O
treat  O
CFTR  O
-  O
associated  O
diseases  O
.  O

Accumulating  O
evidence  O
suggests  O
that  O
CFTR  O
complexes  O
with  O
NHERF2  O
and  O
LPA2  O
at  O
the  O
apical  O
plasma  O
membrane  O
of  O
airway  O
and  O
gut  O
epithelial  O
cells  O
  O
which  O
couples  O
the  O
LPA2  O
-  O
mediated  O
signaling  O
to  O
CFTR  O
channel  O
function  O
.  O

Several  O
approaches  O
could  O
be  O
explored  O
to  O
target  O
this  O
complex  O
to  O
fine  O
tune  O
CFTR  O
channel  O
activity  O
  O
including  O
using  O
specific  O
disruptors  O
of  O
LPA2  O
–  O
NHERF2  O
interaction  O
and  O
specific  O
LPA2  O
modulators  O
.  O

With  O
the  O
technological  O
advancements  O
in  O
drug  O
discovery  O
  O
we  O
believe  O
that  O
more  O
potent  O
and  O
specific  O
small  O
molecules  O
will  O
be  O
identified  O
and  O
tested  O
  O
which  O
will  O
provide  O
us  O
more  O
tools  O
to  O
gain  O
insights  O
into  O
the  O
pathophysiology  O
of  O
CFTR  O
and  O
to  O
combat  O
CFTR  O

Discussion  O

Recent  O
studies  O
have  O
demonstrated  O
that  O
H2S    B-Chemical
  O
like  O
nitric    B-Chemical
oxide    I-Chemical
(  O
NO    B-Chemical
)  O
and  O
carbon    B-Chemical
monoxide    I-Chemical
(  O
CO    B-Chemical
)  O
is  O
justified  O
to  O
be  O
defined  O
as  O
a  O
physiological  O
transmitter  O
(  O
Linden  O
et  O

Wang  O

).  O

Like  O
NO    B-Chemical
and  O
CO    B-Chemical
  O
H2S    B-Chemical
is  O
a  O
small  O
gaseous  O
and  O
freely  O
permeable  O
molecule  O
.  O

The  O
physiological  O
importance  O
of  O
H2S    B-Chemical
has  O
been  O
underscored  O
by  O
its  O
significance  O
in  O
the  O
regulation  O
of  O
several  O
functions  O
including  O
GI  O

Of  O
these  O
three  O
enzymes  O
  O

have  O
been  O
well  O
studied  O

Both  O

use  O

a  O
substrate  O
to  O
produce  O
H2S    B-Chemical
(  O
Wang  O

Although  O
the  O
pattern  O
of  O
expression  O
of  O
CSE  O
and  O
CBS  O
in  O
various  O

is  O

The  O

due  O
to  O
the  O

  O

the  O

it  O

to  O
obtain  O

In  O
this  O

  O
the  O

significantly  O
lowers  O

also  O
produce  O

It  O
has  O

that  O

this  O

  O

  O
a  O

the  O

To  O
explain  O
this  O
behavior  O
  O
some  O
authors  O
have  O
proposed  O
that  O
the  O
least  O
energetic  O
conformation  O
of  O
the  O
Cope  O

is  O
what  O
determines  O
the  O
elemane    B-Chemical
configuration  O


However  O
  O
any  O
of  O
these  O
arguments  O
can  O
explain  O
the  O
configuration  O
of  O
3  O
.  O

Compound  O
3  O
has  O
neither  O
the  O
configuration  O
of  O
the  O
most  O
stable  O
conformer  O
of  O
1  O
(  O

nor  O
the  O
configuration  O
of  O
the  O
least  O
energetic  O

of  O
the  O
Cope  O
TS  O
(  O
a  O

that  O

Compound  O
3  O
comes  O
from  O

which  O
is  O
not  O

from  O

Then  O
  O
why  O
does  O
compound  O
3  O
have  O
this  O
configuration  O
?  O

The  O
answer  O
is  O
simple  O
  O
although  O
not  O
obvious  O
  O
the  O
elemanolide    B-Chemical
2  O
has  O
the  O
right  O
configuration  O
to  O
allow  O
a  O
hemiacetalization  O
that  O
reduced  O
its  O
energy  O
via  O
the  O
formation  O
of  O
a  O
significantly  O
more  O
stable  O
hemiacetaled  O
elemanolide    B-Chemical
3  O
.  O

The  O
configuration  O
of  O
3  O
is  O
the  O
most  O
stable  O
among  O
all  O
other  O
possible  O
configurations  O
.  O

Therefore  O
  O
the  O
energy  O
of  O
the  O
different  O
elemane    B-Chemical
configurations  O
and  O
their  O
possible  O
subsequent  O
rearrangement  O
reactions  O
should  O
also  O
be  O
considered  O
when  O
a  O

Thus  O
  O
the  O

the  O

Again  O
  O
the  O

an  O

determines  O
the  O

The  O
conclusion  O
is  O
that  O
the  O
γ    B-Chemical

lactone    I-Chemical
ring  O
in  O
the  O
Cope  O
rearrangement  O
destabilizes  O
the  O

it  O
has  O
a  O
little  O
or  O
no  O
effect  O
in  O

This  O
conclusion  O
could  O
be  O
extrapolated  O
to  O
any  O
5  O

membered  O
or  O
smaller  O
rings  O

The  O
smaller  O
a  O
ring  O
is  O
the  O
more  O
susceptible  O
it  O
is  O
to  O
the  O
strain  O

Conclusion  O

The  O
Cope  O
rearrangement  O
is  O
commonly  O
used  O
to  O
determine  O
the  O
germacrane    B-Chemical
conformation  O
in  O
solution  O
  O
since  O
the  O
specialized  O
literature  O
establishes  O
that  O
the  O
elemane    B-Chemical
configuration  O
is  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
most  O
stable  O
conformer  O
of  O
germacrane    B-Chemical
.  O

However  O
  O
this  O
is  O
not  O
always  O
TRUE  O
as  O
in  O
the  O
case  O
studied  O
here  O
  O
where  O
the  O
product  O
observed  O
has  O
neither  O
the  O
configuration  O
of  O
the  O
most  O
stable  O
conformer  O
nor  O
the  O
configuration  O
of  O
the  O
least  O
energetic  O
conformation  O
of  O
the  O
Cope  O
TS  O
.  O

The  O
configuration  O
of  O
elemane    B-Chemical
3  O
is  O
the  O
most  O
stable  O
configuration  O
of  O
this  O
compound  O
.  O

Therefore  O
  O
it  O
is  O
also  O
important  O
to  O
consider  O
the  O
energy  O
of  O
the  O
different  O
configurations  O
of  O
an  O
elemane    B-Chemical
to  O
correctly  O
predict  O
the  O
conformation  O
of  O
a  O
germacrene    B-Chemical
.  O

Interestingly  O
  O
the  O
(    B-Chemical
Z    I-Chemical
    I-Chemical
E    I-Chemical
)-    I-Chemical
germacranes    I-Chemical
are  O
significantly  O
more  O

than  O
(    B-Chemical
E    I-Chemical
    I-Chemical
E    I-Chemical
)-    I-Chemical
germacranes    I-Chemical
.  O

Then  O
  O
cis  O
/  O
trans  O
isomerization  O
can  O
only  O
happen  O
in  O
one  O
way  O
  O
(    B-Chemical

germacranes    I-Chemical
.  O

Moreover  O
  O
this  O
isomerization  O
cannot  O
be  O
thermally  O
activated  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
high  O
energy  O
of  O
the  O
associated  O

is  O
an  O

coenzyme  O
of  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
aromatic  O
amino  O
acid  O
hydroxylases  O

BH4    B-Chemical
is  O
also  O
required  O
by  O
nitric  O
oxide  O
synthases  O
(  O

)  O
both  O
for  O
enzyme  O

and  O
for  O

Further  O
  O
BH4    B-Chemical
is  O
the  O
coenzyme  O
of  O
alkylglycerol  O
monooxygenase  O
which  O
catalyzes  O
irreversible  O

lipid    I-Chemical

.  O

BH4    B-Chemical
is  O
autogenously  O
synthesized  O
in  O
various  O
cells  O
which  O
require  O
this  O
compound  O
as  O
the  O
coenzyme  O
.  O

Inherited  O
BH4    B-Chemical
deficiencies  O
are  O
characterized  O
by  O
hyperphenylalaninemia  O
and  O
defective  O
biosynthesis  O
of  O
classic  O
monoamines    B-Chemical
such  O
as  O
dopamine    B-Chemical

  O
adrenaline    B-Chemical
  O
as  O
well  O
as  O

BH4    B-Chemical
supplementation  O
ameliorates  O
hyperphenylalaninemia  O
in  O
cases  O
of  O
inherited  O
BH4    B-Chemical
deficiency  O
and  O
also  O
benefits  O
patients  O
with  O

BH4    B-Chemical
therapy  O
using  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
has  O
been  O
successful  O
in  O
replacing  O
BH4    B-Chemical
except  O
in  O
the  O
brain  O
.  O

Once  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
is  O
administered  O
to  O
animals  O
  O
presumably  O
including  O
humans  O
  O
a  O
certain  O
portion  O
is  O
utilized  O
in  O
replacing  O
innate  O
BH4    B-Chemical
and  O
is  O
integrated  O
through  O
endogenous  O
metabolic  O
pathways  O
  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
intake  O
of  O
vitamins  O
.  O

The  O
most  O
common  O
use  O
of  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
to  O
date  O
is  O
as  O
an  O
orphan  O
drug  O
for  O
these  O
inherited  O
diseases  O
.  O

However  O
  O
like  O
most  O
drugs  O
or  O
supplements  O
  O
its  O
retention  O
in  O
the  O
body  O
is  O
inefficient  O
.  O

According  O
to  O
the  O
guidelines  O
for  O
BH4    B-Chemical
therapy  O
  O
the  O
recommended  O
dose  O
is  O
5  O
–  O
15  O
mg  O
/  O
kg  O
of  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
a  O
day  O
  O
roughly  O
600  O
mg  O
for  O
a  O
60  O
kg  O
adult  O
patient  O
.  O

These  O
doses  O
are  O
over  O
several  O
hundred  O
times  O
greater  O
than  O
the  O
0  O
.  O
98  O
mg  O
lost  O
daily  O
in  O
urinary  O
excretion  O
which  O
is  O
likely  O
close  O
to  O
the  O
amount  O
of  O
BH4    B-Chemical
synthesized  O
daily  O
in  O
healthy  O
humans  O
.  O

BH4    B-Chemical
replacement  O
has  O
also  O
drawn  O
increased  O
attention  O
with  O
respect  O
to  O
whether  O
it  O
ameliorates  O
NOS  O
dysfunction  O
in  O
the  O
cardio  O
-  O
vascular  O
system  O
.  O

NOS  O
dysfunction  O
is  O
largely  O
caused  O
by  O
an  O
increase  O
in  O
BH2    B-Chemical
relative  O
to  O
BH4    B-Chemical
  O
a  O
type  O
of  O
oxidative  O
stress  O
  O
rather  O
than  O
by  O
a  O
deficiency  O
in  O
BH4    B-Chemical
.  O

One  O
simple  O
hypothesis  O
was  O
that  O
supplying  O
BH4    B-Chemical
in  O
an  O
amount  O
exceeding  O
the  O
endogenous  O
BH4    B-Chemical
level  O
would  O
pull  O
the  O
redox  O
balance  O
of  O
BH2    B-Chemical
and  O
BH4    B-Chemical
in  O
favor  O
of  O
a  O
relative  O
BH4    B-Chemical
increase  O
.  O

This  O
hypothesis  O
was  O
likely  O
based  O
on  O
the  O
assumption  O
that  O
the  O
administered  O
BH4    B-Chemical
would  O
accumulate  O
in  O
the  O
cell  O
interior  O
keeping  O
its  O
tetrahydro  O
-  O
form  O
.  O

This  O
approach  O
to  O
ameliorating  O
cardio  O
-  O
vascular  O
symptoms  O
caused  O
by  O
NOS  O
dysfunction  O
has  O
had  O
limited  O
success  O
to  O
date  O
.  O

In  O
recent  O
reports  O
of  O
trials  O
on  O
portal  O
hypertension  O
  O
the  O
authors  O
concluded  O
that  O
“  O
Sapropterin    B-Chemical
(  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
·    I-Chemical
2HCl    I-Chemical
)  O
markedly  O
increased  O
tetrahydrobiopterin    B-Chemical
(  O
BH4    B-Chemical
)  O
levels  O
  O
but  O
also  O
levels  O
of  O
its  O
oxidized  O
forms  O
  O
which  O
may  O
counteract  O
its  O
potential  O
beneficial  O
effects  O
.”  O

In  O
general  O
  O
an  O
intracellularly  O
functional  O
and  O
hydrophilic  O
compound  O
such  O
as  O
BH4    B-Chemical
might  O
be  O
impermeable  O
to  O
the  O
lipid    B-Chemical
bilayer    I-Chemical
of  O
the  O
cell  O

.  O

Needless  O
to  O
say  O
  O
permeation  O
of  O
BH4    B-Chemical
across  O
the  O
cell  O
membrane  O
might  O
require  O
appropriate  O
transporters  O
.  O

Although  O
our  O
knowledge  O
of  O
BH4    B-Chemical
transport  O
is  O
incomplete  O
  O
we  O
attempted  O
to  O
clear  O
some  O
of  O
this  O
ambiguity  O
by  O
characterizing  O
the  O
relevant  O
transporter  O
(  O

involved  O
in  O
the  O
BH4    B-Chemical

The  O
work  O
addresses  O
three  O
vital  O
areas  O
  O
A  O
  O
B  O
  O
and  O
C  O
  O
of  O
which  O
the  O
core  O
processes  O
have  O
been  O
unclear  O
due  O
to  O
a  O
lack  O
of  O
knowledge  O
of  O
the  O
crucial  O

involved  O

The  O
extreme  O

seen  O
after  O

administration  O
was  O
likely  O
brought  O
about  O
by  O
the  O
short  O
retention  O
of  O
BH4    B-Chemical
in  O
the  O

caused  O
by  O
its  O
massive  O
exclusion  O
into  O
urine  O
and  O
feces  O
  O
about  O
a  O
90  O
%  O
gross  O

exclusion  O
  O
which  O
exceeded  O
more  O
than  O
60  O

of  O
the  O
dose  O
  O
and  O
took  O
place  O
within  O
2  O

in  O

.  O

The  O
rapid  O
exclusion  O
to  O
urine  O
essentially  O
occurred  O
via  O
renal  O
tubular  O
secretion  O
  O
namely  O
  O
by  O
trans  O

cellular  O
transport  O
across  O
the  O

These  O
processes  O
obviously  O
involved  O
a  O
form  O
of  O
high  O

capacity  O

activity  O
.  O

The  O
process  O
was  O
most  O
probably  O

by  O
at  O

two  O
transporters  O
acting  O
in  O

Along  O
this  O

The  O

high  O

in  O
the  O

The  O

to  O
be  O
the  O

in  O

It  O
was  O
also  O
suggested  O
that  O
the  O
PBC  O

played  O
a  O
key  O
role  O
in  O
lowering  O
the  O

BH4    B-Chemical
ratio  O
which  O
would  O
otherwise  O
be  O
raised  O
by  O
BH4    B-Chemical
administration  O
.  O

We  O
searched  O
for  O
a  O
transporter  O
which  O
was  O
able  O
to  O
uptake  O
BH4    B-Chemical
in  O
a  O
PBC    B-Chemical
-  O
sensitive  O
manner  O
in  O
the  O
kidney  O
.  O

Here  O
  O
we  O
report  O
that  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
  O
representatives  O
of  O
the  O
organic  O
anion  O
transporter  O
families  O
SLC22A6  O
and  O
SLC22A8  O
  O
are  O
the  O
plausible  O
biopterin  O
transporters  O
engaging  O
in  O
massive  O
BH4    B-Chemical
exclusion  O
in  O
the  O
kidney  O
after  O
BH4    B-Chemical
administration  O
.  O

These  O
transporters  O
have  O
been  O
localized  O
at  O
the  O
basolateral  O
membrane  O
of  O
renal  O
tubular  O
epithelium  O
  O
and  O
they  O
are  O
both  O
sensitive  O
to  O
PBC    B-Chemical
and  O
have  O
characteristic  O
substrate  O
specificities  O
but  O
with  O
an  O
overlapping  O
preference  O
.  O

Their  O
fundamental  O
features  O
as  O
transporters  O
at  O
the  O
molecular  O
level  O
  O
such  O
as  O
their  O
substrate  O
selectivity  O
  O
tissue  O
distribution  O
  O
and  O
localization  O
of  O
their  O
gene  O
expression  O
  O
have  O
been  O
extensively  O
studied  O
(  O
for  O
reviews  O
).  O

Accordingly  O
  O
we  O
first  O
examined  O
whether  O
renal  O
epithelial  O
cells  O
were  O
able  O
to  O
take  O
up  O
BH4    B-Chemical
using  O
kidney  O
slices  O
.  O

We  O
then  O
examined  O
whether  O
rOAT1  O
-  O
and  O
rOAT3  O
-  O
expressing  O
LLC  O
-  O
PK1  O
cells  O
of  O
renal  O
epithelial  O
origin  O
exhibited  O
specific  O
uptake  O
of  O
BH4    B-Chemical
  O
BH2    B-Chemical
and  O
SP    B-Chemical
.  O

We  O
confirmed  O
their  O
preference  O
for  O
BH2    B-Chemical
and  O
SP    B-Chemical
  O
precursors  O
of  O
the  O
BH4    B-Chemical
salvage  O
pathway  O
  O
using  O
a  O
Xenopus  O
oocyte  O
system  O
expressing  O
the  O
respective  O
transporters  O
.  O

Our  O
finding  O
that  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
were  O
well  O
suited  O
to  O
acting  O
as  O
a  O
gateway  O
of  O
the  O
salvage  O
pathway  O
of  O
BH4    B-Chemical
biosynthesis  O
prompted  O
us  O
to  O
conclude  O
that  O
these  O
transporters  O
played  O
a  O
crucial  O
role  O
in  O
lowering  O
the  O
BH2    B-Chemical
/  O
BH4    B-Chemical
ratio  O
by  O
scavenging  O
BH2    B-Chemical
after  O

As  O

would  O
expect  O

Kidney  O
slices  O
are  O
known  O
to  O
be  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
functional  O
systems  O
in  O

with  O
regard  O
to  O
their  O
characteristic  O
uptake  O
which  O
takes  O
place  O
exclusively  O
at  O
the  O
basolateral  O
membrane  O
due  O
to  O
occlusion  O
at  O
the  O
cut  O

.  O

Accordingly  O
  O
BH4    B-Chemical
uptake  O
by  O
the  O
slices  O
in  O
this  O
manner  O
was  O
accounted  O
for  O
by  O
the  O
basolateral  O
uptake  O
of  O
tubular  O
epithelium  O
.  O

Furthermore  O
  O
the  O
80  O
%  O
suppression  O
by  O
PBC    B-Chemical
strongly  O
suggested  O
that  O
the  O
relevant  O
transporters  O
involved  O
in  O
the  O
BH4    B-Chemical
uptake  O
were  O
mostly  O
the  O
organic  O
anion  O
transporters  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
which  O
were  O
reported  O
to  O
participate  O
in  O
the  O
removal  O
of  O
various  O

Although  O
the  O
involvement  O
of  O
other  O
transporters  O
in  O
BH4    B-Chemical
removal  O
was  O
not  O
ruled  O

near  O
exclusive  O
participation  O

the  O

Discussion  O

In  O
earlier  O
studies  O
  O
we  O
noted  O
a  O
facilitated  O
clearance  O
of  O
BP    B-Chemical
by  O
the  O
kidney  O
  O
particularly  O
after  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
administration  O
  O
and  O
we  O
demonstrated  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
tubular  O
secretion  O
of  O
exogenous  O
BH4    B-Chemical
  O
distinct  O
from  O
removal  O
by  O
renal  O
glomerular  O
filtration  O
.  O

In  O
our  O
in  O
vivo  O
experiments  O
analyzing  O
the  O
effect  O
of  O
PBC    B-Chemical
on  O
the  O
pharmacokinetics  O
of  O
administered  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
in  O
rats  O
  O
we  O
showed  O
that  O
a  O
PBC    B-Chemical
-  O
sensitive  O
transporter  O
(  O
s  O
)  O
enabled  O
the  O
liver  O
and  O
kidney  O
to  O
play  O
their  O
crucial  O
role  O
in  O
bodily  O
retention  O
of  O
BH4    B-Chemical
and  O
tubular  O
secretion  O
to  O
the  O
urine  O
.  O

Organic  O
anion  O
transporters  O
(  O
OATs  O
)  O
are  O
representative  O
PBC    B-Chemical
-  O
sensitive  O
transporters  O
known  O
to  O
participate  O
in  O
the  O
uptake  O
process  O
in  O
certain  O
tissues  O
such  O
as  O
the  O
kidney  O
and  O
liver  O
and  O
to  O
exhibit  O
a  O
particular  O
localization  O
.  O

The  O
role  O
they  O
play  O
in  O
kidney  O
clearance  O
of  O
various  O
xenobiotics  O
and  O
metabolic  O
wastes  O
has  O
been  O
well  O
studied  O
(  O
reviews  O
).  O

We  O
previously  O
demonstrated  O
that  O
ENT1  O
and  O
ENT2  O
were  O
capable  O
of  O
transporting  O
SP    B-Chemical
  O
BH2    B-Chemical
and  O
BH4    B-Chemical
  O
and  O
that  O
both  O
were  O
relevant  O
as  O
a  O
gateway  O
of  O
the  O
BH4    B-Chemical
salvage  O
pathway  O
.  O

ENTs  O
comprise  O
a  O
family  O
of  O
equilibrative  O
transporters  O
that  O
mediate  O
the  O
bidirectional  O
permeation  O
of  O
nucleobases    B-Chemical
and  O
similar  O
heterocyclic    B-Chemical
compounds    I-Chemical
across  O
biological  O
membranes  O
  O
indicating  O
that  O
BH4    B-Chemical
and  O
nucleotides    B-Chemical
share  O
a  O
common  O
gateway  O
for  O
the  O
salvage  O
pathway  O
.  O

Their  O
near  O
ubiquitous  O
distribution  O
  O
including  O
in  O
endothelial  O
cells  O
  O
seemed  O
to  O
be  O
appropriate  O
for  O
their  O
body  O
-  O
wide  O
role  O
in  O
biopterin    B-Chemical
distribution  O
  O
however  O
  O
more  O
tissue  O
-  O
specific  O
localization  O
of  O
vigorous  O
transporters  O
was  O
expected  O
for  O
massive  O
kidney  O
-  O
specific  O
clearing  O
.  O

We  O
therefore  O
looked  O
for  O
other  O
transporters  O
which  O
could  O
play  O
a  O
major  O
role  O
in  O
mediating  O
biopterin    B-Chemical
permeation  O
and  O
clearance  O
by  O
the  O
kidney  O
.  O

Accordingly  O
  O
we  O
focused  O
our  O
present  O
search  O
on  O
tubular  O
epithelium  O
in  O
examination  O
of  O
biopterin    B-Chemical
exclusion  O
.  O

OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
as  O
biopterin  O
transporters  O

Our  O
first  O
clue  O
to  O
uncovering  O
the  O
transporters  O
responsible  O
for  O
biopterin    B-Chemical
uptake  O
came  O
from  O
using  O
kidney  O
slices  O
which  O
took  O
up  O
BH4    B-Chemical
and  O
finding  O
that  O
this  O
uptake  O
was  O
strongly  O
inhibited  O
by  O
PBC    B-Chemical
together  O
with  O
other  O
ligands  O
of  O
OAT1  O
and  O
/  O
or  O
OAT3  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
also  O
known  O
that  O
uptake  O
by  O
the  O
basolateral  O
side  O
of  O
tubular  O
epithelium  O
can  O
be  O
exclusively  O
elicited  O
in  O
vitro  O
using  O
rat  O
kidney  O
slices  O
.  O

Hence  O
  O
we  O
hypothesized  O
that  O
the  O
transporters  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
were  O
responsible  O
for  O
driving  O
the  O
renal  O
exclusion  O
of  O
biopterin    B-Chemical
after  O
systemic  O
administration  O
of  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
.  O

In  O
order  O
to  O
prove  O
this  O
hypothesis  O
  O
we  O
employed  O
an  O
expression  O
system  O
using  O
LLC  O
-  O
PK1  O
cells  O
transfected  O
with  O
the  O
rat  O
OAT  O
genes  O
rOat1  O
and  O
rOat3  O
following  O
a  O
method  O
which  O
established  O
the  O
functionality  O
of  O
these  O
transporters  O
in  O
the  O
uptake  O
required  O
for  O
the  O
exclusion  O
of  O
organic  O
anions  O
  O
nucleobases    B-Chemical
and  O
nucleosides    B-Chemical
.  O

As  O
a  O
result  O
  O
the  O
ability  O
of  O
these  O
transporters  O
was  O
strongly  O
suggested  O
to  O
mediate  O
the  O
cellular  O
uptake  O
of  O
BH4    B-Chemical
  O
BH2    B-Chemical
  O
and  O
SP    B-Chemical
.  O

One  O
uncertainty  O
in  O
this  O
experimental  O
system  O
was  O
that  O
the  O
naïve  O
LLC  O
-  O
PK1  O
cells  O
were  O
able  O
to  O
take  O
up  O
BP    B-Chemical
to  O
a  O
noticeable  O
extent  O
.  O

However  O
  O
this  O
fraction  O
of  O
BP    B-Chemical
uptake  O
was  O
thought  O
to  O
be  O
mediated  O
by  O
other  O
transporters  O
such  O
as  O
the  O
ENTs  O
which  O
are  O
rather  O
ubiquitous  O
and  O
essential  O
for  O
proliferation  O
of  O
cells  O
in  O
culture  O
owing  O
to  O
their  O
fundamental  O
role  O
as  O
a  O
gateway  O
of  O
the  O
nucleotide    B-Chemical
salvage  O
pathway  O
.  O

The  O
ability  O
of  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
to  O
transport  O
BH4    B-Chemical
  O
BH2    B-Chemical
and  O
SP    B-Chemical
was  O
further  O
confirmed  O
by  O
the  O
uptake  O
experiment  O
using  O
Xenopus  O
oocytes  O
expressing  O
the  O
human  O
OAT  O
genes  O
hOAT1  O
and  O
hOAT3  O
.  O

Although  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
both  O
have  O
a  O
strong  O
ability  O
to  O
transport  O
BH4    B-Chemical
  O
BH2    B-Chemical
  O
and  O
SP    B-Chemical
  O
this  O
does  O
not  O
necessarily  O
infer  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
the  O
proprietary  O
transporters  O
in  O
BP    B-Chemical
uptake  O
.  O

Instead  O
  O
we  O
consider  O
that  O
BP    B-Chemical
in  O
plasma  O
was  O
targeted  O
as  O
a  O
xenobiotic  O
or  O
metabolic  O
waste  O
to  O
be  O
eliminated  O
by  O
the  O
kidney  O
.  O

The  O
present  O
result  O
does  O
not  O
exclude  O
the  O
possible  O
relevance  O
to  O
BP    B-Chemical
permeation  O
of  O
other  O
transporters  O
not  O
examined  O
here  O
.  O

Relevance  O
of  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
in  O
systemic  O
BH4    B-Chemical
metabolism  O

As  O
for  O
the  O
body  O
-  O
wide  O
relevance  O
of  O
OATs  O
in  O
BH4    B-Chemical
metabolism  O
  O
we  O
observed  O
a  O
major  O
movement  O
of  O
administered  O
BH4    B-Chemical
  O
including  O
massive  O
accumulation  O
in  O
the  O
liver  O
and  O
rapid  O
exclusion  O
from  O
the  O
kidney  O
.  O

Notably  O
  O
in  O
the  O
liver  O
and  O
kidney  O
  O
these  O
processes  O
were  O
both  O
inhibited  O
by  O
prior  O
treatment  O
with  O
PBC    B-Chemical
.  O

Based  O
on  O
these  O
observations  O
  O
we  O
considered  O
that  O
the  O
PBC  O
-  O
sensitive  O
transporter  O
(  O
s  O
)  O
played  O
a  O
crucial  O
role  O
in  O
enabling  O
the  O
liver  O
to  O
absorb  O
and  O
retain  O
a  O
large  O
amount  O
of  O
BP    B-Chemical
and  O
the  O
kidney  O
to  O
take  O
it  O
up  O
and  O
exclude  O
it  O
in  O
the  O
urine  O
.  O

Renal  O
trans  O
-  O
epithelial  O
transport  O
is  O
composed  O
of  O
tandem  O
permeations  O
across  O
the  O
cell  O
membrane  O
  O
namely  O
  O
uptake  O
from  O
the  O
vascular  O
side  O
and  O
release  O
from  O
the  O
tubular  O
lumen  O
side  O
  O
in  O
which  O
the  O
former  O
was  O
strongly  O
prevented  O
by  O
PBC    B-Chemical
and  O
the  O
latter  O
  O
by  O
CSA    B-Chemical
.  O

In  O
the  O
present  O
study  O
  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
were  O
identified  O
as  O
the  O
major  O
PBC  O
-  O
sensitive  O
transporters  O
for  O
BP    B-Chemical
exclusion  O
.  O

However  O
  O
if  O
they  O
act  O
too  O
vigorously  O
to  O
exclude  O
BP    B-Chemical
  O
this  O
would  O
raise  O
concern  O
that  O
BP    B-Chemical
could  O
be  O
thoroughly  O
removed  O
from  O
the  O
body  O
.  O

In  O
addressing  O
this  O
issue  O
  O
we  O
previously  O
examined  O
BP    B-Chemical
levels  O
in  O
urine  O
and  O
plasma  O
separately  O
from  O
red  O
blood  O
cells  O
.  O

We  O
noted  O
that  O
most  O
of  O
the  O
plasma  O
BP    B-Chemical
  O
whose  O
level  O
rose  O
sharply  O
after  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
administration  O
  O
was  O
rapidly  O
and  O
massively  O
excluded  O
in  O
the  O
urine  O
by  O
trans  O
-  O
cellular  O
BP    B-Chemical
secretion  O
which  O
far  O
exceeded  O
glomerular  O
filtration  O
but  O
only  O
until  O
the  O
point  O
at  O
which  O
the  O
plasma  O
BP    B-Chemical
had  O
decreased  O
to  O
about  O
1  O
nmol  O
/  O
mL  O
  O
10  O
-  O
fold  O
the  O
endogenous  O
level  O
  O
and  O
the  O
level  O
remained  O
higher  O
than  O
the  O
endogenous  O
level  O
for  O
a  O
period  O
of  O
hours  O
.  O

Considering  O
the  O
exclusion  O
dynamics  O
of  O
exogenous  O
BP    B-Chemical
  O
these  O
transporters  O
likely  O
play  O
the  O
core  O
role  O
in  O
removing  O
extraordinarily  O
high  O
concentrations  O
of  O
plasma  O
BP    B-Chemical
as  O
a  O
sort  O
of  O
protective  O
mechanism  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
transporter  O
ligands  O
CSA    B-Chemical
and  O
PBC    B-Chemical
strongly  O
blocked  O
the  O
exclusion  O
of  O
BP    B-Chemical
across  O
the  O
epithelium  O
to  O
the  O
urine  O
  O
they  O
raised  O
the  O
blood  O
BP    B-Chemical
to  O
a  O
very  O
high  O
concentration  O
while  O
they  O
had  O
no  O
effect  O
on  O
the  O
glomerular  O
filtration  O
of  O
BP    B-Chemical
.  O

The  O
ligand  O
treatment  O
  O
therefore  O
  O
did  O
not  O
improve  O
the  O
efficiency  O
of  O
BP    B-Chemical
replacement  O
because  O
the  O
inhibition  O
of  O
the  O
trans  O
-  O
cellular  O
BP    B-Chemical
passage  O
was  O
offset  O
by  O
a  O
more  O
rapid  O
outflow  O
through  O
glomerular  O
filtration  O
due  O
to  O
a  O
compensatory  O
elevation  O
of  O
plasma  O
BP    B-Chemical
.  O

Despite  O
the  O
“  O
low  O
efficiency  O
”  O
of  O
peripherally  O
administered  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
  O
this  O
supplement  O
can  O
provide  O
enough  O
BH4    B-Chemical
cofactor  O
for  O
pterin  O
-  O
dependent  O
hydroxylases  O
in  O
peripheral  O
organs  O
  O
such  O
as  O
the  O
liver  O
  O
in  O
patients  O
with  O
an  O
endogenous  O
BH4    B-Chemical
deficiency  O
.  O

6RBH4    B-Chemical
administration  O
immediately  O
elevates  O
plasma  O
BP    B-Chemical
levels  O
.  O

We  O
consider  O
that  O
an  O
extreme  O
concentration  O
higher  O
than  O
threshold  O
was  O
targeted  O
for  O
biological  O
detoxification  O
by  O
means  O
of  O
the  O
tubular  O
secretion  O
in  O
which  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
played  O
the  O
essential  O
role  O
.  O

Hence  O
  O
the  O
“  O
low  O
efficiency  O
”  O
in  O
BH4    B-Chemical
supplementation  O
was  O
a  O
consequence  O
of  O
the  O
blood  O
BP    B-Chemical
elevation  O
over  O
the  O
critical  O
level  O
  O
which  O
was  O
10  O
-  O
fold  O
the  O
endogenous  O
level  O
in  O
the  O
case  O
of  O
rats  O
  O
in  O
the  O
early  O
period  O
after  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
administration  O
.  O

Remarks  O
on  O
the  O
relevance  O
of  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
for  O
systemic  O
BH2    B-Chemical
scavenging  O
after  O
BH4    B-Chemical
supplementation  O

Contrary  O
to  O
general  O
expectations  O
  O
the  O
administration  O
of  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
initially  O
caused  O
an  O
increase  O
in  O
BH2    B-Chemical
in  O
the  O
circulation  O
.  O

However  O
  O
the  O
elevated  O
BH2    B-Chemical
ratio  O
declined  O
within  O
a  O
short  O
time  O
and  O
dropped  O
even  O
further  O
to  O
a  O
level  O
lower  O
than  O
the  O
initial  O
level  O
.  O

An  O
initial  O
surge  O
in  O
BH2    B-Chemical
and  O
a  O
sharp  O
elevation  O
of  O
the  O
BH2    B-Chemical
/(  O
BH2    B-Chemical
+  O
BH4    B-Chemical
)  O
ratio  O
was  O
first  O
observed  O
in  O
the  O
blood  O
in  O
a  O
BH4    B-Chemical
replacement  O
experiment  O
in  O
which  O
mice  O
were  O
intraperitoneally  O
administered  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
  O
7    B-Chemical
    I-Chemical
8BH2    I-Chemical
or  O
SP    B-Chemical
.  O

A  O
rather  O
long  O
-  O
lasting  O
BH2    B-Chemical
increase  O
was  O
also  O
observed  O
in  O
rat  O
plasma  O
after  O
intravenous  O
administration  O
of  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
  O
subsequently  O
  O
the  O
elevated  O
BH2    B-Chemical
ratio  O
in  O
the  O
plasma  O
gradually  O
returned  O
to  O
normal  O
over  O
a  O
period  O
of  O
hours  O
.  O

Presumably  O
  O
the  O
increased  O
plasma  O
BH2    B-Chemical
had  O
been  O
removed  O
by  O
its  O
selective  O
uptake  O
and  O
was  O
subsequently  O
converted  O
to  O
BH4    B-Chemical
.  O

This  O
consequence  O
was  O
paradoxically  O
illustrated  O
by  O
the  O
finding  O
that  O
treating  O
the  O
rat  O
with  O
PBC    B-Chemical
prior  O
to  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
administration  O
strongly  O
stimulated  O
the  O

We  O
have  O
demonstrated  O
in  O
this  O
work  O
that  O
both  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
drove  O
the  O
cellular  O
uptake  O
of  O

The  O
liver  O
and  O
kidney  O
are  O
undoubtedly  O
well  O
furnished  O
with  O
a  O
BH4    B-Chemical
salvage  O
pathway  O
as  O
shown  O
by  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
the  O

ratio  O
  O
BH2    B-Chemical
/(  O
BH2    B-Chemical

BH4    B-Chemical
)  O
in  O
these  O
organs  O
did  O
not  O
significantly  O
change  O
even  O
after  O
the  O
massive  O
uptake  O
of  O
BH2    B-Chemical
from  O
the  O
plasma  O
after  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
administration  O
.  O

BH2    B-Chemical
uptake  O
is  O
a  O
prerequisite  O
of  O
BH2    B-Chemical
conversion  O
to  O
BH4    B-Chemical
in  O
the  O
liver  O
and  O
of  O
BH2    B-Chemical
removal  O
to  O
the  O
urine  O
by  O
the  O
kidney  O
.  O

Furthermore  O
  O
the  O
strong  O
preference  O
of  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
for  O
BH2    B-Chemical
over  O
BH4    B-Chemical
made  O
it  O
much  O
more  O
efficient  O
for  O
these  O
organs  O
to  O
perform  O
their  O
respective  O
functions  O
.  O

Based  O
on  O
these  O
reports  O
together  O
with  O
the  O
present  O
observation  O
regarding  O
the  O
transporter  O
preference  O
for  O
BH2    B-Chemical
  O
we  O
consider  O
that  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
work  O
as  O
part  O
of  O
a  O
body  O
-  O
wide  O
machinery  O
for  O
scavenging  O
BH2    B-Chemical
and  O
maintaining  O
the  O
redox  O
balance  O
  O
at  O

after  O
BH4    B-Chemical
administration  O
.  O

With  O

to  O
phenylalanine  O

tyrosine  O
-  O
and  O
tryptophan  O
hydroxylases  O
  O
the  O
relative  O
increase  O
in  O
BH2    B-Chemical
does  O
not  O
interfere  O
with  O
the  O
enzyme  O
activity  O
to  O
any  O
significant  O
extent  O
  O
however  O
  O
it  O
does  O
lead  O
to  O
a  O
critical  O
failure  O
in  O
NOS  O
function  O
.  O

Administration  O
of  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
has  O
been  O
attempted  O
as  O
a  O
translational  O
medicinal  O
approach  O
to  O
improving  O
eNOS  O
dysfunction  O
  O
especially  O
in  O
cardio  O
-  O
vascular  O
disorders  O
.  O

The  O
dysfunction  O
of  O
eNOS  O
is  O
characterized  O
by  O
uncontrolled  O
uncoupling  O
of  O
O2    B-Chemical
reduction  O
producing  O
“  O
reactive    B-Chemical
oxygen    I-Chemical
/    I-Chemical
nitrogen    I-Chemical
species    I-Chemical
”  O
(  O
ROS    B-Chemical
/  O
RNS    B-Chemical
)  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
believed  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
great  O
risk  O
factor  O
for  O
cardio  O
-  O
vascular  O
disease  O
.  O

Various  O
encouraging  O
experimental  O
studies  O
have  O
been  O
reported  O
  O
however  O
  O
these  O
attempts  O
have  O
had  O
limited  O
success  O
in  O
trials  O
to  O
ameliorate  O
human  O
cardio  O
-  O
vascular  O
dysfunction  O
.  O

The  O
binding  O
of  O
BH2    B-Chemical
to  O
active  O
NOS  O
causes  O
an  O
uncoupling  O
of  O
the  O
O2    B-Chemical
reduction  O
involved  O
in  O
the  O
enzyme  O
reaction  O
.  O

To  O
avoid  O
sustained  O
eNOS  O
dysfunction  O
  O
the  O
enzyme  O
should  O
not  O
be  O
exposed  O
to  O
a  O
high  O
concentration  O
of  O
BH2    B-Chemical
relative  O
to  O
BH4    B-Chemical
because  O
the  O
affinity  O
of  O
NOS  O
for  O
BH2    B-Chemical
was  O
reported  O
to  O
be  O
not  O
particularly  O
low  O
  O
the  O
IC50  O
of  O
BH2    B-Chemical
to  O
eNOS  O
was  O
comparable  O
to  O
that  O
of  O
BH4    B-Chemical
and  O
the  O
Ki  O
of  O
nNOS  O
to  O
BH2    B-Chemical
was  O
only  O
10  O
-  O
fold  O
higher  O
than  O
to  O
BH4    B-Chemical
.  O

Hence  O
  O
the  O
success  O
of  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
administration  O
for  O
improving  O
NOS  O
dysfunction  O
might  O
primarily  O
depend  O
on  O
its  O
lowering  O
of  O
the  O
BH2    B-Chemical
/(  O
BH2    B-Chemical
+  O
BH4    B-Chemical
)  O
ratio  O
rather  O
than  O
on  O
raising  O
the  O
BH4    B-Chemical
concentration  O
.  O

This  O
has  O
been  O
noted  O
by  O
many  O
researchers  O
.  O

As  O
two  O
examples  O
  O
(  O
1  O
)  O
the  O
importance  O
of  O
the  O
BH4    B-Chemical
salvage  O
pathway  O
driven  O
by  O
dihydrofolate  O
reductase  O
has  O
been  O
well  O
documented  O
and  O
the  O
scavenging  O
of  O
BH2    B-Chemical
was  O
shown  O
to  O
be  O
enabled  O
by  O
vigorous  O
reductase  O
activity  O
.  O

The  O
authors  O
argued  O
that  O
endothelial  O
cells  O
were  O
poorly  O
furnished  O
with  O
dihydrofolate  O
reductase  O
  O
which  O
made  O
NOS  O
function  O
in  O
these  O
cells  O
extremely  O
vulnerable  O
to  O
BH2    B-Chemical
produced  O
in  O
situ  O
in  O
the  O
cell  O
interior  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
also  O
reported  O
that  O
(  O
2  O
)  O
endothelial  O
cells  O
of  O
human  O
origin  O
showed  O
dramatically  O
less  O
dihydrofolate  O
reductase  O
activity  O
compared  O
to  O
cells  O
of  O
other  O
species  O
including  O
cows  O
and  O
mice  O
.  O

Taken  O
together  O
  O
endothelial  O
cells  O
did  O
not  O
appear  O
to  O
have  O
the  O
means  O
to  O
scavenge  O
BH2    B-Chemical
in  O
the  O
local  O
cell  O
interior  O
.  O

Nonetheless  O
  O
blood  O
BH2    B-Chemical
can  O
be  O
produced  O
either  O
near  O
or  O
at  O
some  O
distance  O
away  O
from  O
local  O
endothelial  O
cells  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
  O
endothelial  O
cells  O
readily  O
take  O
up  O
plasma  O
BH2    B-Chemical
because  O
of  O
their  O
asymmetrically  O
dense  O
expression  O
of  O
ENT2  O
on  O
the  O
apical  O
membrane  O
facing  O
the  O
vascular  O
lumen  O
side  O
.  O

As  O
an  O
extreme  O
example  O
  O
after  O
BH4    B-Chemical
administration  O
  O
eNOS  O
of  O
endothelial  O
cells  O
is  O
vigorously  O
exposed  O
to  O
a  O
high  O
BH2    B-Chemical
concentration  O
from  O
the  O
circulating  O
blood  O
.  O

In  O
this  O
context  O
  O
attenuation  O
of  O
systemic  O
BH2    B-Chemical
production  O
or  O
stimulation  O
of  O
BH2    B-Chemical
scavenging  O
has  O
a  O
direct  O
impact  O
on  O
the  O
eNOS  O
dysfunction  O
of  O
endothelial  O
cells  O
.  O

This  O
work  O
has  O
demonstrated  O
that  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
are  O
both  O
involved  O
in  O
systemic  O
BH2    B-Chemical
scavenging  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
their  O
characteristic  O
mediation  O
of  O
BH2    B-Chemical
uptake  O
and  O
their  O
known  O
distribution  O
on  O
the  O
vascular  O
side  O
of  O
renal  O
tubular  O
endothelium  O
.  O

Effective  O
BH2    B-Chemical
scavenging  O
in  O
the  O
kidney  O
is  O
obviously  O
enabled  O
by  O
the  O
high  O
-  O
capacity  O
uptake  O
of  O
blood  O
BH2    B-Chemical
mediated  O
by  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
.  O

Although  O
OAT3  O
is  O
the  O
dominant  O
OAT  O
expressed  O
in  O
the  O
liver  O
  O
other  O
OAT  O
counterparts  O
in  O
this  O
organ  O
  O
such  O
as  O
OAT2  O
  O
are  O
also  O
interesting  O
but  O
their  O
roles  O
remain  O
elusive  O
.  O

Relevance  O
of  O
PBC  O

transporters  O
in  O

in  O
the  O
urine  O

As  O
a  O
matter  O
of  O
general  O
physiology  O
  O
we  O
are  O
also  O
interested  O
in  O
the  O
relevance  O
of  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
in  O
the  O
homeostasis  O
of  O
BH4    B-Chemical
metabolism  O
under  O
ordinary  O
conditions  O
without  O
exogenous  O
BH4    B-Chemical
supplementation  O
.  O

Our  O
experiments  O
addressed  O
this  O
issue  O
(  O
Fig  O
.  O

4  O
)  O
and  O
demonstrated  O
that  O
the  O
administration  O
of  O
PBC    B-Chemical
to  O
healthy  O
rats  O
significantly  O
decreased  O
BP    B-Chemical
exclusion  O
in  O
the  O
urine  O
which  O
was  O
accompanied  O
by  O
a  O
rise  O
of  O
BP    B-Chemical
in  O
the  O
blood  O
  O
with  O
both  O
levels  O
measured  O
using  O
the  O
same  O
individual  O
rats  O
.  O

Since  O
there  O
are  O
no  O
known  O
reasons  O
for  O
the  O
drug  O
to  O
stimulate  O
de  O
novo  O
BP    B-Chemical
biosynthesis  O
  O
the  O
increase  O
in  O
the  O
blood  O
BP    B-Chemical
was  O
accounted  O
by  O
a  O
kickback  O
from  O
inhibition  O
of  O
the  O
renal  O
secretion  O
of  O
BP    B-Chemical
by  O
PBC    B-Chemical
.  O

These  O
results  O
suggested  O
that  O
the  O
loss  O
of  O
BP    B-Chemical
through  O
the  O
urine  O
strongly  O
influences  O
the  O
endogenous  O
amount  O
of  O
BP    B-Chemical
in  O
the  O
blood  O
.  O

We  O
also  O
observed  O
that  O
the  O
BP    B-Chemical
content  O
in  O
the  O
kidney  O
was  O
significantly  O
increased  O
in  O
the  O
presence  O
of  O
PBC    B-Chemical
.  O

An  O
almost  O
proportional  O
increase  O
in  O
kidney  O
BP    B-Chemical
relative  O
to  O
blood  O
BP    B-Chemical
was  O
even  O
more  O
pronounced  O
in  O
our  O
previous  O
study  O
in  O
which  O
rats  O
were  O
administered  O
“  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
alone  O
”  O
or  O
“  O
6RBH4    B-Chemical
+  O
PBC    B-Chemical
”.  O

The  O
mechanism  O
of  O
this  O
in  O
vivo  O
increase  O
involving  O
local  O
OAT1  O
and  O
/  O
orOAT3  O
remains  O
unclear  O
.  O

Since  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
are  O
the  O
only  O
known  O
PBC  O
-  O
sensitive  O
transporters  O
which  O
enable  O
BP    B-Chemical
to  O
permeate  O
across  O
the  O
cell  O
membrane  O
  O
it  O
is  O
highly  O
plausible  O
that  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
  O
if  O
not  O
acting  O
locally  O
in  O
the  O
kidney  O
  O
are  O
involved  O
in  O
the  O
mechanism  O
controlling  O
the  O
bodily  O
retention  O
of  O
BH4    B-Chemical
.  O

However  O
  O
this  O
subject  O
awaits  O
further  O
in  O
vivo  O
exploration  O
.  O

As  O
mentioned  O
at  O
the  O
beginning  O
of  O
the  O
Discussion  O
  O
ENT1  O
and  O
ENT2  O
have  O
been  O
identified  O
as  O
BP  O
transporters  O
.  O

ENTs  O
and  O
OATs  O
are  O
similar  O
in  O
their  O
preference  O
for  O
SP    B-Chemical
and  O
BH2    B-Chemical
as  O
substrates  O
rather  O
than  O
BH4    B-Chemical
.  O

However  O
  O
in  O
contrast  O
to  O
the  O
localization  O
of  O
OATs  O
in  O
specific  O
tissues  O
such  O
as  O
in  O
the  O
kidney  O
and  O
liver  O
  O
ENTs  O
are  O
characterized  O
by  O
their  O
near  O
ubiquitous  O
distribution  O
including  O
in  O
endothelial  O
cells  O
.  O

Generally  O
speaking  O
  O
it  O
is  O
likely  O
that  O
ENT1  O
and  O
ENT2  O
assume  O
their  O
share  O
of  O
the  O
mobilization  O
of  O
BP    B-Chemical
  O
including  O
its  O
precursor  O
SP    B-Chemical
  O
in  O
the  O
body  O
interior  O
  O
while  O
OAT1  O
and  O
OAT3  O
deal  O
with  O
detoxication  O
in  O
response  O
to  O
a  O
BP    B-Chemical

and  O

in  O

The  O

Mycobacterium  O

Among  O

a  O

for  O

PtpA  O
is  O

  O
such  O

We  O
thus  O

To  O

The  O

that  O

the  O
most  O

Although  O
steric  O

likely  O
to  O
play  O
a  O
role  O
in  O
the  O
observed  O
regioselective  O
modification  O
''  O
we  O
confirmed  O
a  O
water    B-Chemical

structural  O

that  O
modulates  O
the  O

also  O
found  O
in  O
the  O
phosphatase  O
SptpA  O

indicates  O
that  O
the  O
mechanism  O

actually  O

conserved  O
among  O

share  O
structural  O
identity  O

the  O

This  O
hitherto  O
unknown  O

key  O
for  O

Discussion  O

The  O

a  O

Currently  O
''  O
five  O

genes  O
(  O
CPT  O

''  O
CPT  O
Iα2a  O
''  O
CPT  O

were  O
identified  O
in  O

Moreover  O
''  O
these  O
studies  O
indicated  O
that  O
''  O
compared  O
with  O
other  O
isoforms  O
''  O
mRNA  O
levels  O
of  O
CPT  O
Iα1b  O
and  O
CPT  O
1α2a  O
were  O
predominant  O
in  O
the  O
liver  O
.  O

Therefore  O
''  O
CPT  O
Iα1b  O
and  O
CPT  O
1α2a  O
were  O
considered  O
as  O
the  O
liver  O

.  O

To  O
investigate  O
their  O
transcriptional  O
regulatory  O
mechanism  O
''  O
for  O
the  O
first  O
time  O
''  O
we  O
cloned  O
the  O
sequences  O
of  O
CPT  O
Iα1b  O
and  O
CPT  O
Iα2a  O
promoters  O
in  O
fish  O
''  O
and  O
explored  O
their  O
functional  O
characteristics  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
present  O
study  O
''  O
we  O
found  O
two  O
TSSs  O

to  O

alternative  O
5  O

splice  O

of  O

Iα1b  O
mRNA  O
.  O

Studies  O
suggested  O
that  O
alternative  O
TSSs  O
usually  O
occurred  O
in  O
the  O
proximal  O
promoter  O
of  O
genes  O
lacking  O
TATA  O
and  O
CCAAT  O
boxes  O
.  O

Batarseh  O
et  O
al  O
.  O

pointed  O
out  O
that  O
multiple  O
TSSs  O
were  O
typically  O
TATA  O

and  O
they  O
were  O
located  O
within  O
CpG  O

that  O
the  O

(  O
CPT  O

)  O
promoter  O
was  O
GC  O
rich  O

TATA  O

less  O
and  O
had  O
an  O
alternative  O
transcription  O
initiation  O
.  O

However  O
''  O
our  O
present  O
study  O
found  O
some  O
variations  O
in  O
TSSs  O
of  O
the  O
CPT  O
Iα1b  O
promoter  O
in  O
grass  O
carp  O
.  O

Grass  O
carp  O
CPT  O
Iα1b  O
promoter  O
was  O
AT  O
-  O
rich  O
and  O
contained  O
two  O
TATA  O
elements  O
without  O
canonical  O
CpG  O
islands  O
''  O
but  O
DNase  O
I  O
foot  O
printing  O
assay  O
showed  O
that  O
both  O
TATA  O
elements  O
were  O
not  O
protected  O
from  O
DNase  O
I  O
digestion  O
''  O
whereas  O
the  O

which  O
encompassed  O
the  O
TSS  O
''  O
was  O
protected  O
from  O
DNase  O
I  O
digestion  O
.  O

These  O
phenomena  O
indicated  O
that  O
the  O
basal  O
transcription  O
of  O
the  O
CPT  O
Iα1b  O
gene  O
required  O
the  O
INR  O
to  O
position  O

transcription  O
machinery  O
.  O

In  O
agreement  O
with  O
our  O
study  O
''  O
Smale  O
and  O
Kadonaga  O
pointed  O
out  O
that  O
the  O
INR  O
was  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
TSS  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
independent  O
of  O
''  O

in  O
synergy  O
with  O
the  O
TATA  O

Thus  O
''  O
our  O
results  O
suggested  O
that  O
the  O
basal  O
transcription  O
of  O
the  O
CPT  O
Iα1b  O

might  O
be  O
mediated  O
through  O

the  O

roles  O

Moreover  O
''  O
we  O
also  O
discovered  O
that  O

declined  O
in  O
the  O

1646  O
bp  O
of  O

.  O

Obviously  O
''  O
some  O
negative  O
regulators  O
binding  O
on  O
these  O
regions  O
regulated  O
CPT  O
Iα1b  O
and  O
CPT  O
Iα2a  O
expression  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
''  O
studies  O
suggested  O
that  O
the  O
luciferase  O
activity  O
declined  O
in  O
the  O
deletion  O
region  O
from  O
more  O
that  O
−  O
6000  O

to  O
−  O
1653  O
bp  O
on  O
the  O
promoter  O
of  O

CPT  O
Iα  O
.  O

However  O
''  O
the  O
present  O
study  O
indicated  O
that  O
the  O
transcription  O
activity  O
increased  O
on  O
the  O
upstream  O
of  O
the  O
promoters  O
of  O
grass  O
carp  O
CPT  O
Iα1b  O
and  O
CPT  O
Iα2a  O
''  O
suggesting  O
that  O

the  O
upstream  O
region  O
of  O
CPT  O
Iα1b  O
and  O
CPT  O
Iα2a  O
promoters  O
.  O

Thus  O
''  O
it  O
appears  O
that  O
the  O
regulation  O
of  O
CPT  O
Iα1b  O
and  O
CPT  O
Iα2a  O
transcription  O
was  O
more  O
complicated  O
in  O
fish  O
than  O
mammals  O
.  O

PPARs  O
are  O
key  O
transcriptional  O
factors  O
which  O
mediate  O
the  O
regulation  O
of  O
many  O
enzymes  O
related  O
with  O

.  O

Studies  O
suggested  O
that  O
CPT  O
I  O
was  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
target  O
genes  O
of  O
PPARα  O

In  O
our  O
study  O
''  O
the  O
activities  O
of  O

were  O
induced  O
by  O

However  O
''  O
site  O

EMSA  O
analysis  O
indicated  O
that  O
CPT  O
Iα1b  O

CPT  O
Iα2a  O
were  O
not  O
regulated  O
through  O
those  O
predicted  O
PPARα  O
binding  O
sites  O
.  O

Accordingly  O
''  O
the  O
reporter  O
activities  O
were  O
up  O
-  O
regulated  O
by  O
fenofibrate    B-Chemical
''  O
indicating  O
that  O

PPARα  O

other  O
related  O
factors  O
existed  O
on  O
the  O

.  O

For  O
instance  O
''  O
studies  O
suggested  O
that  O
PPARα  O

activate  O

Additionally  O

the  O
induction  O
of  O
CPT  O
Iα1b  O

CPT  O
Iα2a  O
by  O

PPARγ  O

factors  O
which  O
plays  O
important  O
roles  O
in  O

The  O
present  O

indicated  O
that  O
transcription  O
of  O

Moreover  O

that  O
the  O

that  O
