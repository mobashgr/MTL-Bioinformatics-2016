a	O

(	O

It	O
should	O
be	O
noted	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
VEGF	O

in	O
this	O

may	O
be	O
derived	O
from	O
chicken	O

probably	O
binds	O

However	O

a	O

,	O
so	O
this	O
argument	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
very	O
significant	O

The	O
question	O
remains	O
why	O
neutralizing	O
vascular	O
endothelial	O
growth	O
factor	O
(	O
VEGF	O
)	O
does	O
not	O
work	O
so	O
well	O
,	O
while	O
inhibition	O

VEGFR	O

does	O
.	O
	
This	O
could	O
mean	O
that	O
neutralization	O
of	O
VEGF	O
by	O
a	O
large	O

—	O
an	O

is	O
much	O

than	O
inhibiting	O
the	O
VEGFR	O

a	O

Another	O
explanation	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
broader	O
activity	O
spectrum	O
of	O
axitinib	B-Chemical
.	O
	
This	O
then	O
raises	O
the	O
question	O
why	O
axitinib	B-Chemical
works	O
better	O
than	O
sunitinib	B-Chemical
.	O
	
However	O
,	O
the	O
most	O
likely	O
explanation	O
for	O
this	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
affinity	O
of	O
axitinib	B-Chemical
for	O
VEGFR	O
-	O
2	O
is	O
some	O
40	O

A	O
similar	O
discussion	O
is	O
valid	O
for	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
angiogenesis	O
inhibition	O
prior	O
to	O
PDT	O
.	O
	
Here	O
,	O
bevacizumab	B-Chemical
not	O
only	O
lacks	O
improvement	O
of	O
PDT	O
but	O
also	O
seems	O
to	O
counteract	O
the	O
efficacy	O
of	O
PDT	O
.	O
	
Apparently	O
,	O
the	O
presence	O
of	O
VEGF	O
is	O
necessary	O
for	O
an	O
effective	O
PDT	O
outcome	O
.	O
	
It	O
can	O
be	O
assumed	O
that	O
VEGF	O

induced	O
active	O
cell	O
metabolism	O
is	O
necessary	O
for	O
effective	O

This	O
also	O

that	O
the	O
major	O
effect	O
of	O
PDT	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
applied	O
conditions	O
,	O
is	O
through	O

The	O
