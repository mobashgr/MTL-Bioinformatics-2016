Therefore O
oxidation O

the O

were O
believed O
to O
affect O
the O

[ O

In O
this O
study O
we O
found O
that O
the O
oxidized O
residues O
were O
close O
to O
the O

site O
or O
located O
in O
the O

formed O

These O
observations O
are O
supported O
by O
previous O
reports O
demonstrating O
that O
mutations O
and O
modifications O
close O
to O
the O
active O
site O
significantly O
affect O
the O
structural O
stability O
as O
well O
as O
the O
catalytic O

of O
MNSOD O
[ O

]. O
In O

the O

when O
normalized O
by O
MNSOD O
expression O
was O
decreased O
in O
ccRCC O
in O

with O
the O

. O
We O
therefore O
speculated O
that O
the O
newly O
identified O
oxidative O
modification O
may O
initially O
affect O
the O
structure O
then O
compromise O
the O
catalytic O
activity O
of O
MNSOD O
and O
thereby O
contribute O
to O
ccRCC O

Using O

we O
found O
that O

To O

we O

time O
that O

can O
be O

As O
protein O
oxidation O

the O

[ O

we O
speculated O
that O
the O
oxidation O

H54 O

Y58 O
W147 O

W149 O
mediated O
MNSOD O

thereby O

It O
also O
accounts O
for O
the O
inconsistency O
of O

MNSOD O

ccRCC O
versus O

Cancer O
cells O
produce O
greater O
amount O

their O

thus O
more O

However O

HSPs O
have O

Among O

HSP90 O
consists O
of O
three O
domains O
such O
as O
N O

acts O

It O
has O
been O

that O

that O

Therefore O

become O
as O
one O
of O
the O

Regarding O

Therefore O

of O
various O

Bone O

With O

In O

been O
shown O
that O
geldanamycin B-Chemical
induces O
autophagy O

[ O

However O
the O
exact O
roles O
of O
HSP90 O
in O
bone O

have O
not O
yet O
been O
fully O
clarified O

Interleukin O

( O
IL O

) O
is O
a O
multifunctional O
cytokine O
which O
belongs O
to O
the O
glycoprotein O
130 O
( O

cytokine O
family O
and O
has O
important O
physiological O

on O

such O
as O
the O
promotion O

cell O

and O
the O
induction O
of O
acute O

proteins O
[ O
16 O
17 O
]. O
It O
has O
been O
recognized O
that O
IL O
- O

stimulates O
bone O
resorption O
and O
induces O
osteoclast O
formation O
[ O
17 O

and O
IL O

reportedly O
plays O
a O
pivotal O
role O
in O
the O
process O
of O
bone O

[ O
18 O

Thus O
accumulating O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
IL O

is O
an O
osteotropic O
modulator O
and O
influence O
bone O

under O
the O

On O

prostaglandins B-Chemical

Among O

PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
which O
has O
been O
conventionally O
recognized O
as O
a O

agent O
[ O
20 O
] O
is O
currently O
recognized O
as O
a O
bone O

It O
has O
been O
previously O
reported O
that O

osteoblast O

[ O

We O
have O
previously O
shown O
that O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
stimulates O
the O
synthesis O
of O
IL O

6 O
through O
p44 O

kinase O
in O
osteoblast O

like O
MC3T3 O

[ O

Thus O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
the O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical

induced O
IL O
- O
6 O
synthesis O
is O
not O
specific O
for O
osteoblast O
- O
like O
MC3T3 O

E1 O
cells O
but O
general O
phenomena O
in O

However O
there O
is O
no O

the O

as O
we O
know O

In O
addition O
we O
have O
reported O
that O
Rho O

significantly O
suppress O
the O

and O
the O

induced O
by O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
without O
affecting O
the O
levels O
of O

p38 O
MAP O

these O

suggesting O
that O
Rho O

a O
role O

as O
an O

These O

lead O
us O
to O

that O
HSP90 O

regulate O
the O

In O

Discussion O
In O
the O
present O
study O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
HSP90 O
inhibitors O
including O
geldanamycin B-Chemical
17 B-Chemical
- I-Chemical
AAG I-Chemical
and O
17 B-Chemical
- I-Chemical
DMAG I-Chemical
significantly O
enhanced O
the O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
- O
stimulated O
release O
of O
IL O
- O
6 O
in O
osteoblast O
- O
like O
MC3T3 O
- O
E1 O
cells O
. O
We O
also O
found O
that O
onalespib B-Chemical
another O
type O
HSP90 O
inhibitor O
[ O
31 O
] O
amplified O
the O
IL O
- O
6 O
release O
induced O
by O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
in O
these O
cells O
. O
In O
addition O
we O
showed O
that O
the O
expression O
levels O
of O
IL O
- O
6 O
mRNA O
induced O
by O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
were O
markedly O
amplified O
by O
geldanamycin B-Chemical
and O
onalespib B-Chemical
. O
Thus O
it O
seems O
likely O
that O
the O
amplifying O
effect O
of O
HSP90 O
inhibitors O
on O
the O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
- O
stimulated O
IL O
- O
6 O
release O
is O
mediated O
through O
the O
gene O
transcription O
in O
MC3T3 O
- O
E1 O
cells O
. O
Based O
on O
our O
findings O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
HSP90 O
plays O
an O
inhibitory O
role O
in O
the O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
- O
stimulated O
IL O
- O
6 O
synthesis O
in O
osteoblast O
- O
like O
MC3T3 O
- O
E1 O
cells O
. O
To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge O
this O
is O
probable O
the O
first O
report O
showing O
the O
suppression O
by O
HSP90 O
of O
IL O
- O
6 O
synthesis O
in O
osteoblasts O
. O
Therefore O
we O
next O
investigated O
the O
exact O
mechanism O
behind O
the O
suppression O
by O
HSP90 O
of O
the O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
- O
stimulated O
IL O
- O
6 O
synthesis O
in O
osteoblast O
- O
like O
MC3T3 O
- O
E1 O
cells O
. O
Regarding O
the O
intracellular O
signaling O
system O
of O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
in O
osteoblasts O
we O
have O
previously O
shown O
that O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
stimulates O
the O
synthesis O
of O
IL O
- O
6 O
through O
p44 O
/ O
p42 O
MAP O
kinase O
and O
p38 O
MAP O
kinase O
in O
osteoblast O
- O
like O
MC3T3 O
- O
E1 O
cells O
[ O
23 O
24 O
]. O
Additionally O
in O
our O
previous O
study O
[ O
25 O
] O
we O
have O
reported O
that O
Rho O
- O
kinase O
positively O
regulates O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
- O
stimulated O
IL O
- O
6 O
synthesis O
at O
a O
point O
upstream O
of O
not O
p44 O
/ O
p42 O
MAP O
kinase O
but O
p38 O
MAP O
kinase O
in O
MC3T3 O
- O
E1 O
cells O
. O
Thus O
we O
investigated O
whether O
HSP90 O
inhibitors O
affect O
the O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
- O
stimulated O
activation O
of O
p44 O
/ O
p42 O
MAP O
kinase O
or O
p38 O
MAP O
kinase O
in O
these O
cells O
. O
However O
neither O
geldanamycin B-Chemical
nor O
17 B-Chemical
- I-Chemical
AAG I-Chemical
affected O
the O
phosphorylation O
of O
p44 O
/ O
p42 O
MAP O
kinase O
. O
On O
the O
contrary O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
geldanamycin B-Chemical
17 B-Chemical
- I-Chemical
AAG I-Chemical
and O
onalespib B-Chemical
significantly O
enhanced O
the O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
- O
stimulated O
phosphorylation O
of O
p38 O
MAP O
kinase O
. O
Therefore O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
the O
enhancement O
by O
HSP90 O
inhibitors O
of O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
- O
stimulated O
IL O
- O
6 O
synthesis O
is O
due O
to O
up O
- O
regulating O
the O
activation O
of O
p38 O
MAP O
kinase O
but O
not O
p44 O
/ O
p42 O
MAP O
kinase O
in O
MC3T3 O
- O
E1 O
cells O
. O
In O
addition O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
either O
geldanamycin B-Chemical
or O
17 B-Chemical
- I-Chemical
AAG I-Chemical
failed O
to O
affect O
the O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
- O
induced O
phosphorylation O
of O
MYPT O
- O
1 O
a O
substrate O
of O
Rho O
- O
kinase O
[ O
33 O
]. O
We O
also O
found O
that O
HSP90 O
inhibitors O
had O
no O
effect O
of O
the O
amounts O
of O
MYPT O
- O
1 O
RhoA O
or O
Rho O
- O
kinase O
. O
It O
is O
generally O
recognized O
that O
Rho O
and O
the O
down O
- O
stream O
effector O
Rho O
- O
kinase O
play O
crucial O
roles O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
cellular O
functions O
such O
as O
cell O
motility O
and O
smooth O
muscle O
contraction O
[ O
32 O
33 O
]. O
As O
for O
osteoblasts O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
the O
inhibition O
of O
RhoA O
- O
Rho O
- O
kinase O
signaling O
influences O
osteoblast O
adhesion O
differentiation O
and O
mineralization O
[ O
35 O
]. O
In O
the O
present O
study O
we O
showed O
that O
HSP90 O
inhibitors O
failed O
to O
affect O
the O
phosphorylation O
of O
MYPT O
- O
1 O
a O
target O
of O
Rho O
- O
kinase O
. O
Based O
on O
our O
findings O
it O
seems O
unlikely O
that O
the O
amplification O
by O
HSP90 O
inhibitors O
of O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical

- O
6 O
synthesis O
is O
mediated O
through O
the O
enhancement O
of O

. O
Our O
findings O
suggest O
that O
HSP90 O
might O
function O
as O
a O

in O
the O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical

stimulated O
IL O

in O

that O

at O

In O
order O
to O
further O

whether O

The O

were O
significantly O
enhanced O

Additionally O
we O

In O

it O
has O
been O
generally O
recognized O
that O
IL O

acts O
as O
a O
potent O
bone O
resorptive O
agent O
and O
to O
promote O
osteoclast O
formation O
[ O

]. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
IL O

on O

IL O

is O
currently O
considered O
as O

under O
the O
condition O
of O
increased O
bone O
turnover O
and O
is O
inducible O
even O
bone O

[ O

]. O
Bone O
resorption O
is O
the O
primary O
step O
of O

and O

is O
subsequently O

[ O

To O

the O
quality O
the O
adequate O
handling O
of O

process O
performed O
by O
osteoclasts O
and O
osteoblasts O
is O
essential O
. O
Although O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
IL O
- O
6 O
stimulates O
osteoclastic O
bone O
resorption O
IL O
- O
6 O
is O
recognized O
to O
act O
as O
a O
bone O
remodeling O
mediator O
from O
the O
viewpoint O
of O
whole O
bone O
metabolism O
. O
As O
for O
HSP90 O
in O
osteoblasts O
we O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
expression O
levels O
of O
HSP90 O
protein O
are O
quite O
high O
in O
osteoblast O
- O
like O
MC3T3 O
- O
E1 O
cells O
[ O
37 O
]. O
Therefore O
our O
present O
findings O
showing O
that O
HSP90 O
inhibitors O
could O
function O
as O
an O
up O

regulator O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical
- O

in O

probably O
provides O
a O
novel O
insight O
with O
regard O
to O
HSP90 O
as O
an O
essential O
regulator O
of O
bone O
remodeling O
. O
Several O
HSP90 O
inhibitors O
including O
geldanamycin B-Chemical
have O
been O
recognized O
as O
an O
anticancer O
drug O
and O
the O
effects O
of O
HSP90 O
inhibitors O
have O
been O
tested O
in O
the O
clinical O
trial O
[ O
38 O
]. O
Based O
on O
our O
present O
findings O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
HSP90 O
inhibitors O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
anticancer O
chemotherapeutics O
could O
affect O
bone O
metabolism O
as O
a O
bone O
remodeling O
modulator O
through O
the O
enhancement O
of O
IL O
- O
6 O
synthesis O
in O
osteoblasts O
. O
Therefore O
HSP90 O
inhibitors O
might O
lead O
a O
new O
therapeutic O
strategy O
for O
acceleration O
of O
fracture O

and O
bone O

such O

Further O

the O
details O

the O
effects O

In O
conclusion O
our O
results O
strongly O
suggest O
that O
HSP90 O
negatively O
regulates O
the O
PGF2?ñ B-Chemical

Introduction O
Germacranes B-Chemical
are O
biogenetic O
precursors O
of O
elemanes B-Chemical
[ƒ??] O
because O
germacranes B-Chemical
can O
be O
easily O
transformed O
into O
elemanes B-Chemical
by O
heating O
through O
a O
Cope O
rearrangement O
. O
In O
some O
cases O
these O
transformations O
are O
so O
favorable O
that O
it O
has O
been O
mentioned O
that O
the O
observed O
elemanes B-Chemical
are O
only O
artifacts O
produced O
at O
the O
extraction O
[ƒ??]. O
It O
is O
known O
that O

suffer O
Cope O
rearrangements O
at O
temperatures O

but O
some O
structural O
changes O
in O
the O

such O
as O
the O

- O
Cope O
transformation O
allows O
the O
reactions O
to O
happen O
at O
temperatures O
below O

[]. O
The O
Cope O

is O
a O
[ O

sigmatropic O
reaction O
and O
in O
general O
occurs O
through O
a O
single O
transition O
state O
( O

) O
which O
has O
normally O
a O
chair O
conformation O
due O
to O
the O
higher O
energy O
of O
the O

[ƒ??]. O
In O
this O

the O
electron O

of O
the O

is O
delocalized O

[ƒ??]. O
However O
if O
the O

this O

could O
have O

The O

only O
depends O
on O
the O
configuration O
of O
the O
most O

conformer O
since O
it O
is O

It O
is O
accepted O
that O
the O

that O

are O
the O
ones O
that O
